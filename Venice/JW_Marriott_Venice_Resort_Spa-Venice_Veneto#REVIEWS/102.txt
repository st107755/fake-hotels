My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend. Arriving late we took a water taxi to the island. The rooms were spacious with an added feature of having a small private garden. I can also recommend the spa and excellent restaurants. The staff were friendly and very professional. If you stay treat yourself to sneak at Fiola excellent Venetian cuisine and wines.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
