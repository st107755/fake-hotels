The hotel is situated on its own private island. The rooms have a very modern Decor as does the rest of the hotel. The staff were very gracious and friendly and accommodating. The breakfast served was delicious! There is a shuttle that takes you to St. Mark's Square every half hour and it's very convenient to use. We were only there for one night and did not get to experience all the resort had to offer. They have an absolutely stunning rooftop pool! Would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 30, 2016Dear cd58, thank you for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful oasis, modern décor, delicious breakfast, convenient shuttle service and stunning rooftop pool.  Hopefully when you visit us again for a longer stay you will have the chance to check out our GOCO Spa. It is such a wonderful experience and you can spend a whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
