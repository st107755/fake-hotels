This JW is pretty amazing - brand new, with all of the amenities you'd expect at a 5 star hotel. Thanks to the staff for upgrading us to a private apartment with our own pool and view of Venice. The shuttle service to San Marco is convenient and efficient. They're still in the "soft opening" phase, so there were some hiccups, but no deal breakers. The bartender at the lobby bar was American, which was nice since the language barrier can be an issue. If you're going to Venice to celebrate a special occasion, the JW should be your first choice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 3, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you so much for sharing your experience and for having chosen our property in occasion of your getaway to Venice.
