We are pleased to know you appreciated our property, our rooms and the attitude of our Staff and we are deeply sorry you unfortunately noticed some issues related to the air conditioning system.  In recent days, the main hotel at JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa has been experiencing mechanical faults with its engineering infrastructure.   This has resulted in sporadic and short lived discontinuity to the air conditioning systems in some of the main hotel guest rooms, which has impacted on the guest experience.  We are doing all we can to address the issues and have a dedicated engineering task force on property to review and rectify the faults as quickly as possible.   We are extremely sorry for the inconvenience this has caused and we are doing all we can to mitigate the situation in the short term also offering room changes, whenever possible.   We are confident that all systems will be fully operational soon.  We wish also to apologize for any inconvenience caused related to the delay in delivering the extra bed sheets during night; we will take great care of your observations and discuss this with our Management Team.  We apologize again and remain with our sincerest regards,  Paul Downing Acting General ManagerRead more
