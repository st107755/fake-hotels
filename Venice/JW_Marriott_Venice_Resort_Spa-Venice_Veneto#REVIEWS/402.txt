Nice clean hotel in Venice.  The rooms are spacious with very comfortable beds. Nicely appointed bathrooms.  The restaurant is very pricy.    Breakfast was included and was good.  Very nice grounds and nice sunsets. The downside is that it is on an island.  So you hav to take a water shuttle to go to St. Marks square, a 20 minute ride one way.
