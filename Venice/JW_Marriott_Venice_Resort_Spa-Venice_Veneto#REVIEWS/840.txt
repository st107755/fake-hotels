.It is a well-run hotel with good services and excellent location which offers a great deal of privacy. The only shortcoming is that it's at least 15 minute boat ride to the San Marcos Sq. the interior is done via modern Italian architect and, in my opinion, it's too cold and slick. Not something that one would expect in Venice. The rooms are in good condition well kept up which is better than some the other hotels that are more centrally located like Bauer, etc.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 24, 2016Dear jhlivens, thank you for your review. We appreciate your kind words about our well-run hotel, good services and excellent location. However, I am sorry to hear that there were some aspects of your stay that you felt warranted improvement.   You are correct in saying that the design and d√©cor of our unique property is different from the many hotels that would find around San Marco Square, however we are very proud of the beautiful design of our 19 buildings on our private island, which are the work of the renowned Italian architect Matteo Thun. His main focus was to integrate the contemporary elements of the existing buildings to showcase their unique history and personality, while at the same time enhancing the architectural heritage of our location.  Thank you for choosing to stay at the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again in the future.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
