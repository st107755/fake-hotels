I took a friends for a special return trip to this magical city and we couldn't have chosen a better weekend for exceptional weather and a public holiday long weekend too .  There is much to praise this hotel for - not least the well reviewed Marriott service ethic which has been  dialled up with most staff who always want to engage with you at the key customer points. So there is little more I can add to what others have written . The added ambience of being on your own Isola with only boat access to and from the real world adds to the magic of the place .  For me there was so much more could be done to make this place truly 'great' ! I'm not on here to only raise issues , but my 1st explains why I list such items here . 1) we were there for 4 days over a busy weekend howeverâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 2, 2016Dear AndyDave, thank you so much for taking the time to share a review on your recent experience at our resort.
