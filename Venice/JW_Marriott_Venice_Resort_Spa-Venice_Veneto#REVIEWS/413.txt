Upon arrival we were greeted with warm and helpful staff.  The personalized check-in, including a glass of prosecco was the start of great two days.  Marriott Platinum Status helped us be upgraded to a Junior Suite and it was amazing, I only wish we'd had more time to enjoy everything the resort has to offer, but we opted to spend most of our time touring Venezia for our first visit.  This resort offers easy transportation every 30mins to the heart of Venice and yet you feel away from the crowds and tourists.  Marriott should be very proud of it's property and staff, Kudos!!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 30, 2017Dear A M, thanks for your positive feedback on our magical Isola delle Rose.
