The property, situated on an island off of Venice, was idyllic. You arrive by private boat, which alone makes it worth the stay. Rooftop views of the Venice skyline, both early morning and evening were magical. The level of service from the concierge staff is unparalleled. From coordination of activities for various day trips to neighboring islands to dinner reservations and on property activities, the staff went above and beyond. Vittorio, their head concierge, even took personal time to travel to Florence and retrieve a lost package of mine! Incredible! I would go back in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 12, 2016Dear kplannigan, thank you for your review.
