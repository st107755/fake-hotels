There is free shuttle each 30 min.  Highly recommended.

We are grateful for your kind comments about our nice hotel, delicious breakfast and fantastic views.  I am delighted to hear that you were able to explore our beautiful and spacious grounds. With dramatic panoramic views of the Lagoon and the Venetian skyline, our private island is the perfect place to go for a peaceful walk, jog or bike ride. I hope you had the opportunity to rent one of our JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our historical gardens. It really is a fun and memorable way to enjoy our Isola delle Rose.  Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
