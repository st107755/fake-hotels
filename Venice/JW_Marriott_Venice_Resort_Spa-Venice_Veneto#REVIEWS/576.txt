Great place! In an small island, the hotel is nicely located. The main building is nice and the bedrooms are big enough. The bathroom was allright, shower was big. Breakfast is nice and complete.  You have the choise of few restaurant for diner within the hotel, one in rooftop-great!-, one "gastronomic" that was a bit disappointing, and a buffet. Remember in your budget that each travel from the hotel by boat taxi cost a minimum of 80â‚¬. Overall a very good place to stay in venice!Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 23, 2017Dear Tom C, thanks for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our nice location, good facilities and delicious breakfast.  You might be interested to hear that besides the regular menu at our rooftop restaurant Sagra, we also offer a special menu from the Cicchetti Bar, which are Venetian-style tapas. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden. One of my favorite dining experiences is enjoying these Venetian-style tapas while overlooking the dramatic skyline of the Lagoon during sunset at our rooftop.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
