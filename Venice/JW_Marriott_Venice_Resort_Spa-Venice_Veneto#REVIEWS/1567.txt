We are staying in room 001 at this moment.  We arrived on the Sunday and our room wasn't ready which was not a problem.  At 3.30 I returned to reception to see if they had forgotten us.  Room just become ready!!  Very disappointed a basic ,so called deluxe room.  Supposed to be a garden view - a few bushes.  No patio or balcony.  Told "we are full" in a very unpleasant way.  Mini bar but no list of charges.  Small beer in bar ten euros - sandwich 25 euros.  Mixer tap in bath only gave out hot water so had to be fixed.  Coffee machine is hit and miss.  Pay for Wi-Fi. No facilities at family pool apart from bottled water. All in all it was very disappointing considering it was for our 40th wedding anniversary. Won't return and won't recommend.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
