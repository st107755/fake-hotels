We appreciate your kind words about our relaxing atmosphere, confortable rooms and clean and well-maintained hotel.  I am also delighted to hear that you enjoyed your trip to Murano, organized by the resort. The next time you stay with us, you should check out our Squero Tramontin tour to see how gondolas are made. This exclusive excursion via water taxi takes JW guests to the magical place where gondolas are built and repaired.

All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
