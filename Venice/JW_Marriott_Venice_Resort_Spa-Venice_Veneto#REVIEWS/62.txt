The Uliveto De Luxe guest room is not only beautiful but also provided an exclusive check-in service offered by only the finest of hotels.  The reception was just the beginning to the unparalleled personal attention offered by everyone with which we interacted.  If ever you want to experience true hospitality, this is the place for it.  We were fortunate the General Manager took the time to welcome us and assured that all our needs were met.  He and his staff truly make you feel special.  Highly recommend including this property in your travels.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
