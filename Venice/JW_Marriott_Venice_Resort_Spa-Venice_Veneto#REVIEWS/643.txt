What a gem of a property! We arrived in time for the spectrum of sunlight as it bathed Venice's skyline in all it glory and magic. The view from the Rooftop bar was just simply out of this world and the hotel grounds was equally beautiful. The staff at the bar, Domi and Sebastian; and the restaurant Agendah and Manager Ricardo were just delightful. They made us feel right at home with their warmth, hospitality and professionalism. Our drinks and dinner certainly hit the spot! We will definitely recommend the JW Marriott to be on your destination list.
