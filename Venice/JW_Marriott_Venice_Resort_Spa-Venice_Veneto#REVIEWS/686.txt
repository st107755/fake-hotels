Located on the Isola Delle Rosa,the hotel is more like a palace than a hotel. great gardens to walk around, top notch Fitness center and a Michelin rated restaurant, and no crowds. The trip to St. Marks square is twenty minutes by boat. Shuttle runs on the half hour.

Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
