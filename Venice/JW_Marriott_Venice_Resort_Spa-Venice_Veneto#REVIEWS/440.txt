We are thrilled that you enjoyed celebrating your dream wedding at our magical Isola delle Rose! We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful grounds, outstanding service and impressive staff.  I think our private island and luxurious facilities are a perfect venue for a wedding reception. Our historic gardens are one of the most picturesque locations with its scenic 360-degree views of Venice. We have hosted some high-profile events at our park and the feedback was amazing.
