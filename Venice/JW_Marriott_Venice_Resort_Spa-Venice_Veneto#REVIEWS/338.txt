Even before arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by the guest relations manager via email. It was a very welcoming touch and we were even able to have them make dinner reservations in advance for us in Venice. It was a nice touch that got us even more excited for our upcoming trip.  Upon arrival, the hotel and resort is remarkably beautiful. Very well kept and the landscape, flowers, etc. were really eye catching. We were greeted by wonderful staff and were upgraded to a suite in the retreat building. All of the amenities were great and the room was spacious. Everyone was nice and helped us plan our time in Venice to every detail. They even booked our private transport to Murano (20 euro a person on speed boat - the only up sale that was actually worth it.. more on thatâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
