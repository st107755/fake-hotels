Just had 3 nights here and it was excellent. There are a few issues with the place that have clearly wound other reviewers up but didn't really trouble me. The rooftop pool / sun bed is one issue. We found a very comfortable sofa and relaxed with a drink until a bed came up.  Also a lot of people were queuing for breakfast, fortunately not us so I guess we got lucky.  Meal in the rooftop restaurant was a bit average and the drinks a bit overpriced but I guess on an island we are a captive audience to be exploited like that.  All in all I would recommend, especially in peak season as its a bit of a zoo over in the main tourist area.
