We spent 3 nights at this JW Marriott.  Erica welcomed us, checked us in, gave us a full explanation of the property and guided us to our upgraded room.   She was wonderful, professional and a delight to work with.   The property is stunning, rooms are spacious, food is great, and the rooftop pool and bar is not to be missed.  Ilaria who checked us out was also great.   Everyone we spoke with or asked for information was top notch.  We can’t wait to go back.  We were concerned about being remote and that is not the case.  The boat service back and forth is easy and very convenient.  Loved it.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 24, 2017Dear cmacc2017, thanks for your review. We appreciate your generous comments about our outstanding property, wonderful staff, spacious rooms, great food and convenient shuttle service.  What we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to San Marco Square means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city – but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
