We spent 3 days at the JW Marriott for our honeymoon and we have not been disappointed at all!  Luxurious and exclusive, we felt that we were in a special place.  Room: we were on 1st floor (141). Spacious and contemporary. Bed and pillow were very comfortable  Breakfast: good variety, mix of international and local Rooftop bar: great location, amazing view of Venice. Come early if you want to have a bed by the infinite pool. Staff is really attentive and friendly (thanks to Turgut! We had a lovely day by the pool, great service!) GOCO spa: exclusive and intimate. Thanks to Patricia and Daniela for the couple massage. It was simply amazing   Overall: if you are looking to go to Venice but enjoy in a different way, the JW Marriott is the place to stayRead moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 25, 2017Dear LondonTripmember, thank you for taking the time to write a review.
