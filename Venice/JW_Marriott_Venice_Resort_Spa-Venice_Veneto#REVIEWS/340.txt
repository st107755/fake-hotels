We stayed at the JW Marriott Venice in April and the staff and property was the best of the best.  I have not ever witnessed such a cohesive, positive and helpful staff that seemed to genuinely care about making our stay as pleasant as possible.  Nina in the restaurant was particularly wonderfulâ€”kind, thoughtful and so sweet to all of our family.  We highly recommend this resort!Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
