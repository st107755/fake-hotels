What more could you want?  This hotel truly has it all.  The hotel has a water shuttle which docks at St. Mark’s Square for an easy ride to the hotel.  Once there, you will feel the relaxed atmosphere.  The hotel is spacious; more of a resort feel.  There is loads of greenery, which is very different from the hotels back on the square.  The rooms are spacious and very comfortable with good size bathrooms and toiletries.  The breakfast buffet is excellent, everything you could possibly want.  Be sure and pop in the heated roof top pool with spectacular views of Venice.   This is by far the nicest hotel in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Feb 7, 2017Dear Wendys_Travel_Tips, thanks for your review. We appreciate your generous comments about our private location, easy shuttle service, relaxed atmosphere, spacious and comfortable rooms and excellent breakfast buffet.  It sounds like you were able to enjoy our lush grounds. Like you mentioned, our century-old park is a 16-hectare expanse of greenery – a mixture of old trees and soft lawns, which is impossible to find elsewhere in Venice. I think our historic gardens are one of the most picturesque locations with its scenic 360-degree views of Venice.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
