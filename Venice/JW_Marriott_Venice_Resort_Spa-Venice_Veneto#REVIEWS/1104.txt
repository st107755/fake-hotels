Parking fee was EUR 21,00 per day and you don't have to hand over your car keys.  After a 2 minutes walk from the garage we hopped on a Vaporetto which took us to San Marco in about 45 minutes (Line 2). Fifty meters to right of the Vaporetto Station you will find the pier, where the hotel shuttle boat leaves every 30 minutes.

We are delighted that you enjoyed your time at our Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful grounds, friendly staff, delicious food and convenient shuttle service.  I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your dining experiences at our Sagra Rooftop restaurant. I think our rooftop pool is one of the best vantage points to admire breathtaking 360-degree views of Venice and the Lagoon. It is also the ideal place to watch the beautiful Venetian sunset. Many guests tell us how much they enjoy spending Happy Hour there while indulging in a glass of prosecco and some tapas from our Cicchetti Menu. It is an experience not to be missed.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
