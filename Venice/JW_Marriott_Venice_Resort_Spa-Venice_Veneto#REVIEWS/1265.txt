A very nice, comfortable hotel, 15 minutes via boat from St Marks Square, we stayed over Easter, the hotel was very busy but the only real time we noticed this was at breakfast where we had to queue for up to 20 minutes, this really should not have been necessary, as most mornings there were tables free but the staff did not clear them quick enough, not what you would expect from this standard of hotel, this is the only reason I marked down the hotel, everything else is excellent, the shuttle service was always on time, the boats are limited to 39 people and we had to wait for the next boat a couple of times but this is not really a problem, the island the hotel is located on has lovely gardens and is very well maintained, Rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable.

We are delighted that you enjoyed your Easter break at our resort. We appreciate your kind comments about our comfortable hotel, spacious rooms and lovely and well-maintained gardens.  Our century-old park is a 16-hectre expanse of greenery – a mixture of old trees and soft lawns, which is impossible to find elsewhere in Venice. I think our historic gardens are one of the most picturesque locations with its scenic 360-degree views of Venice. Last year we hosted a few weddings and some high-profile events at our park and the feedback was amazing. With it being such a large outdoor facility as well as its island heritage, there is no place in Venice like it.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
