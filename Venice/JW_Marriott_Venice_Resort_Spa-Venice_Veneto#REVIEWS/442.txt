We stayed at the Residence's and had an amazing view of the city. Room was spotless! Of all the places I have stayed, this ranks in the top, up in the very rarefied air. Great staff, modern rooms. Breakfast was included and it was better than expected. The hotel could have easily been a Ritz Carlton. We arrived via private taxi transfer from our cruise ship. It's impressive to arrive into the lobby via boat. Very 007'ish. We had Anna, the concierge book us dinner at several restaurants. Simply a great experience if you are a foodie. And if you identify as a foodie, don't miss an opportunity to eat at Dopolavoro Dining Room. Both my wife and I think it's the best meal we have ever had!Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 7, 2017Dear jetlag66, thanks for your review.
