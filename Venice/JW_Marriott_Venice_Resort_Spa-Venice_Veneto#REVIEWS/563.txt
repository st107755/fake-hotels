My husband and I vacationed at this resort for our honeymoon. The entire experience was top notch from the staff (Romeo and Sara were very kind and helpful) to the food (we ate at every cucina on site and they were all DELICIOUS!), to the 360 views! The spa is a must as it's very tranquil and it's only $35 for three hours. The massages are priced average. I would highly recommend staying at this resort as it's a beautiful hideaway from the busy hustle and bustle of Venice and the mob scene of tourists. The hotel also offers a free shuttle service to and from San Marco- it runs every half an hour. We also were given a free tour of Murano by the hotel. I can't thank the staff enough for their friendliness and exceptional service. Hope to visit again soon!
