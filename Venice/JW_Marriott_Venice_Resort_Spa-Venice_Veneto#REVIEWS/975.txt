The hotel itself is excellent (service, rooms spa, pool) but if you are planning in going to Piazza San Marco the hotel not for you. The destination is not only far as in most of the times not all people would fit in the ferry, so others had to wait another 30 minutes for a new one. The dock on Piazza San Marco is also shared with different hotel ferry's at the same place and there is no supervision making it all a mess.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 15, 2016Dear Leandro A, thanks for your review. We appreciate your kind words about our excellent hotel. However, I am very sorry to hear that you were unsatisfied with the shuttle service to and from Venice. As you mentioned, the dock we have in San Marco is regulated by the Commune de Venezia. We have an allocated time slot for the use of the dock as we are sharing it with two other hotels. Therefore even if we increased the number of our shuttles, we would still only be allowed to arrive on the dock every half an hour.   I would like to reassure you that this kind of situation only happens for a couple of weeks during the summer when our hotel is at full occupancy. We are currently working on rectifying this issue in time for the next high season. Again we are very sorry about the inconvenience caused.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
