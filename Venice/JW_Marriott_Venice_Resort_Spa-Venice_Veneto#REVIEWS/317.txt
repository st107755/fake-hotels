The entire staff at the JW Marriott in Venice could not do enough for us. We had access to a room with our own pool. Bogdan made us feel so welcomed.  We picked this hotel as Marriott Hotels are our first choice. We were very pleased. The breakfast our last morning was amazing.  Thank you for providing such service and accommodationsRead moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
