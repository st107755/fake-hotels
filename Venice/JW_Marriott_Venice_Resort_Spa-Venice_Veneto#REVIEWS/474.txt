This is definitely the best spa we've ever been to.  The staff is very nice and polite and always there for you for any request.  The massage was the best massage we've ever got!! No doubt that the therapists are professional!!   We highly recommend to visit this spa and order a massage. The price is high but it's definitely worth every cent!Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 11, 2017Dear עינב מ, thanks for your review.
