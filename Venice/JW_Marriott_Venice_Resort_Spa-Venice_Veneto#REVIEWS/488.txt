Hotel was great. Room nothing special but clean and attractive. What I most enjoyed was the staff at all locations - from check in to Renata hosting breakfast to (was it Adriana from Romania?), the staff were always friendly, courteous and solicitous without being intrusive. My coffee cup at breakfast never emptied; recommendations for wine and food were excellent. Never got to the Michelin star restaurant, but dinner and dessert on the fourth floor were excellent.   We wondered if a position here was a promotion from other Marriott properties - the staff was that good.

We are grateful for your generous comments about our great hotel, friendly and courteous staff and excellent food.  The next time you visit us, I recommend checking out our delicious gelato. We have partnered up with Bologna-based Gelato & Co. Cremeria Italiana, who produce the best gelato in Italy. They use the freshest ingredients in all of their unique flavors â€“ my all-time favorite is pistachio! We are offering their gelato at our Sagra Rooftop restaurant and we also have a gelato cart by our family pool.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
