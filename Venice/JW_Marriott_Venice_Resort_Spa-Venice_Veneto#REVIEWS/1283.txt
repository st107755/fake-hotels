The service rendered by Gianmarco at the Front Desk was wonderful!  He took care of every need and ensured that my stay was everything I hoped for.  I had a difficult experience at the airport but he helped make up for the issues by kindly offering to assist me in every way possible.  Thank you for your hospitality!  Thank you also to the bartender Ivan for his great service.

We really appreciate your kind comments about our wonderful staff. I will make sure to pass on your compliments to Gianmarco – he will be so happy to hear that he was able to assist you and turn your difficult experience at the airport into a positive one.  The next time you visit you should definitely check out our restaurants. Our resort is a top culinary destination in Venice. Shortly after opening last year, our signature fine dining restaurant Dopolavoro obtained its first Michelin star under the leadership of one of Italy’s most celebrated chefs, Giancarlo Perbellini and his team. It is a luxury dining experience that is not to be missed.  Thank you for choosing to stay at our Isola delle Rose and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
