This is a great hotel situated on it's own island 15 minutes from St Marks, with it's own (free) shuttle/boat. A heated rooftop pool and bar with views of Venice. The staff and service were both impeccable. The boat dock for water taxis is straight out of a James Bond film. Our room was superb with private deck overlooking the olive grove, very peaceful indeed. The food in the restaurant was as good and as authentic as any in Venice. We would recommend the cichetti and a bottle of Prosseco for lunch or a light dinner. The Marriott hotel made our first trip to Venice truly memorable.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 3, 2016Dear JaneParkerB, thanks so much for your wonderful feedback. We are grateful for your kind comments about our great hotel, impeccable customer service, superb views and authentic culinary offering.  I am also delighted to hear that you enjoyed our special menu from the Cicchetti Bar at our Sagra Rooftop restaurant. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden. One of my favorite dining experiences is enjoying these Venetian-style tapas while overlooking the dramatic skyline of the Lagoon during sunset at our rooftop.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
