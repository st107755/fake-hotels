We have travelled to Venice more then 25 times and have seen lot's of hotels. This brand new hotel is a perfect setting after a day walking in busy Venice. You might think it is quite a distance to San Marco, but actually it is not. In fact the shuttle service works great and you get to see something of the lagoon. We were upgraded to a nice loft room, including a small garden with Jacuzzi. Breakfast is served in a church, absolutely great! We had a 5 course dinner at the Dopolavoro restaurant including a wine tasting by their great sommelier! Fantastic spa, best in town. Very relaxing and great supportive staff!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 14, 2015Dear Sir,  How lovely it was to read your review of our JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa!
