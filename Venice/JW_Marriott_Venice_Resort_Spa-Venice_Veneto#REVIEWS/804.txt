Only stayed  1 night but will definitely be going back. Feel very special taking the hotel boat to the island ,on arrival.check in busy but very efficient friendly staff.we were upgraded so had  a beautiful garden room with all facilities that were needed in the room.the hotel facilities were more than adequate where if you just wanted to relax and not bother with sightseeing there is plenty to keep you occupied.We had a little wait for breakfast as the hotel was full,but the wait was worth it ,the standard ,choice and quality of the food was really good.just 2 small quibbles ....less time waiting to check in and for the english guests more than 1 English tea bag in the room pleaseRead moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 7, 2016Dear Mike1955930, thanks so much for your positive feedback. We are grateful for your kind comments about our efficient staff, beautiful rooms, good food and nice facilities.  Hopefully when you visit us again for a longer stay you will have the chance to check out our GOCO Spa. It is such a wonderful experience and you can spend a whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
