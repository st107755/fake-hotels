We stayed in Venice for 3 days, tired.. the second day we stopped at Sagra for dinner. The rooftop restaurant has a good location and a great view; the food was good, the grilled sepia and the scallops were tasty. Elisa was our waitress, she was just AMAZING! making us feel special,  She was worth it the visit! She was friendly and respectful and With her knowledge about food and wine she gave us the best experience ever, I was very impressed !! She will do very good in career and I hope to see her in the States. If all hotels had this type of staff aboard they would be very successful.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 3, 2016Dear dollyad, thanks for your review.
