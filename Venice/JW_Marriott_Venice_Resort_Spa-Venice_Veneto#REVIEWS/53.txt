I read through some of the negative reviews on this hotel and am quite frankly bemused, people commenting on not having a shelf in the shower?! I spared little thought for that and instead was blown away by the service of the staff, the views across the lagoon, and the all round beauty of the island in which the hotel is situated. Completely private, spacious, well maintained and worthy of a 6 star rating. Whilst pricey it was totally worth it, and would visit again in a heartbeat. This truly is a fantastic hotel and would strongly recommend, just perfection. Well done to the team for creating an experience and environment that was pure bliss. Hope to see you again soon, Keeley and Carl.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
