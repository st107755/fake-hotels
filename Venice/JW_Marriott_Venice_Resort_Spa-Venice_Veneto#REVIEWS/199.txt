This is a great hotel, far enough away from the mad tourist areas of Venice to be quiet, yet close enough to absorb the local ambiance.  There are a couple of very good eating options, pleasant grounds to walk around and a great view of the city.  Other upsides include larger than normal (for Europe) rooms, great aircon for the hot summer months and exceptional service.  The downsides are that its isolation (its situated on a private island) means you can't simply leave the hotel and walk around the city whenever you want.  You need to take one of the regularly scheduled boat shuttles or pay for a private water taxi to get back and forth to the city.  The isolation also means your dining selections are a bit more challenging.  All that said, I would go back to this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
