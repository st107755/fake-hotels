We stayed at the JW Marriott for one night before a cruise.  The resort is first class the room we stayed in was amazing (La Residenza Pool Suite) we had a one bedroom suite with a private pool and a great view of St Marks Sq.  The staff was amazing and the rooftop restaurant was outstanding.  We used a private water taxi arranged by the hotel concerege to get to the hotel from the airport and from the hotel to the cruise ship I'm my view those trips were easily worth the price what a cool way to get around.  I stay in Marriott's for business often and this property is one of the nicest.  We can't wait to return to Venice and to stay at the JW for a longer visitRead moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 30, 2016Dear John B, thank you for taking the time to write a review. We appreciate your kind comments about our first-class resort, amazing rooms, attentive staff and outstanding food.  We hope your next visit with us will be a longer one â€“ there is so much to do at our magical Isola delle Rose. When the team and I were organizing the excursions that we wanted to provide our guests, we thought of all the things that would be part of the ultimate travel experience of Italy. From interactive cooking classes with Chef Micki to a tour of a traditional Murano glass-making factory, we wanted to showcase our passion for Italy and highlight some of the wonderful and fascinating aspects of its culture and history. We hope you will be able to check out our exciting activity program during your next stay!  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
