The JW was located on a beautiful island full of all the nicest amenities.  Its only a 20 min boat ride to Venice from the hotel and they do offer rides back and forth every hour.  The staff was very friendly and more than happy to accommodate any tours or trips.  The hotel is newer and the rooms are spacious with excellent bathrooms.  The only complaint was that the towels left on the floor of the bathroom were rehung by room service and the espresso coffee in the room was not restocked.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare
