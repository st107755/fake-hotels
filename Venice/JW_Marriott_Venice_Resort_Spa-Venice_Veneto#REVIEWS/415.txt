Stayed over at this hotel during a business visit for 4 days.  It is located 35 mins from the airport and 15 mins from downtown. Hotel runs a water taxi shuttle service to st Marco square almost till around midnight.  Mind blowing F&B! staff is so nice and capable.  Other than the main hotel block, there are a few super high end villas, gym, spa, meeting rooms are all spread in lovely grounds. There is a Mitchelin star restaurant. Great indoor and outdoor meeting venues.  Only thing to avoid is the mosquitoes! I am sure this is applicable to the region and not this hotel. There is an electrical gadget in one of the drawers and this solves the problem.  Highly recommend his one!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 30, 2017Dear lale g, thanks for your review.
