I stay at a Marriott facility on most of my travels and this property had just opened. This is one amazing place to spend your vacation. The hotel is on a private island, Rose Island. We had 24hr shuttle from the hotel to the city by beautiful, fast boats that run about every 15 minutes. The garden view was great and so was the view of Venice. The rooftop pool was heated with a great view of Venice. Service from all the associates at this facility was great and our stay was one that left us wanting to return. JW Marriott Venice is a must.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 29, 2015Dear Sir,  We would like to thank you for your nice feedback.
