Yes, this property is looking to find its footing as it has recently opened but it is fantastic!  If you have a family this would be the place to stay as there is open space to run and a pool off the hotel for family activity.  The grounds are beautiful and a welcome sight to return to after a day in Venice.  We had a wonderful suite in the outer buildings and air conditioning worked great and the staff was very attentive to our needs.  I would say the only negative is that the water taxi on the return dropped us at the wrong parking garage even though we repeatedly told them where we needed to be.  This meant taking the "People Mover" and thankfully I had researched the area and connections prior or we would have missed our plane out of Marco Polo.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
