We spent 2 nights at the JW.  Overall, it was an amaizng experience.  The property is magnificent, excellent staff and becuase it is on its own island, it is quiet and relaxing. - or so we thought.  Unfortunatley while we were there, the JW was hosting a travel industry contference and threw a party for the attendees (with a loud DJ playing music) til after 11PM.  Becuase of the music, we couldn't enjoy our balcony - or a quiet night on the island as imagined.  This was the most disappointing aspect. Nonetheless, it was our favority property in Italy and we will be back.  We would, however, ask the JW to rethink their party/event situation so not to adversely impact other guests.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
