The JW Marriott Venice was absolutely fantastic and the service was excellent! We ordered room service a couple of times during our stay and Giacomo was incredible. He was very professional and personable. He welcomed us to Venice and was very receptive to our inquiries on discovering the true Venice outside of the touristy areas. He was also very welcoming for us to visit southern Italy, where he was from. Just an overall super nice person.
