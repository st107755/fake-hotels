The place is very beautiful and it is lovely with the pool .The staff is very friendly and nice! Carlos, Valentino, and one of the front office handsome young men definitely worth a mentioned in this review because these are the people i met and they are all excellent staff! We were lucky enough to get upgraded to one of the nicer suites because of our Platinum Status. Room are clean and spacious. Very relax environment and beautiful place. We also had dinner at the Michelin star Dopolavoro Dining and its worth every penny of the money. Food are definitely world class. In short, everything about JW Marriott Venice are great and world class hospitality.
