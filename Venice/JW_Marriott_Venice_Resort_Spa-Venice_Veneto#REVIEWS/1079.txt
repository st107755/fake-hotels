This hotel is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at (and I have been to a lot of places). The rooftop swimming pool is one of the best especially their service! Thanks to Andrea Formico  for taking care of us while we were there. You made our stay much more enjoyable.  Definitely will return to this great hotel and will recommend it to all of my friends.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
