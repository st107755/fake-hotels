Great resort. Very nice staff. We stayed in a uliveto suite. Sarah from the reception desk helped us with information about restaurants, transportation and musea tickets. She was very friendly. You can enjoy a very complete breakfast. Nina brought us the coffee we want, cappuccino, cafe latte... Paolo created the best eggs and always had time to talk to us. There is a shuttle every half an hour to Venice and back. So, after a busy, crowdy day in Venice, you came back in the silent, nice resort.  One minor thing, the beds can be better.

We appreciate your kind comments about our great resort, nice staff and tranquil atmosphere.  As you mentioned, we believe having the ability to escape Veniceâ€™s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit, our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
