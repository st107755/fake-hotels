We do not feel our guestrooms smell as "dog urine" as you indicated: our Housekeeping Service take care of the cleanliness of our rooms and public areas, and the perfume - which actually is a neutral one - is usually appreciated.   Unfortunately it is also hard for us to recognize you and the issues you indicated, as the nickname is an anonymous one and there are no indications of full name details, room number and travelling dates.  Please feel free to contact us directly should you wish to better address your concerns; any feedback is valuable for us as comments allow us to improve our service and dedication to our clientele.  We apologize again if we have not been able to fully meet your expectations and we hope to have a new possibility to experience our Resort in the future.  Sincerest regards,  Linda Bertoni Marketing & Communication ManagerRead more
