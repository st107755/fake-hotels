New Marriott property on Isola delle Rose. Opened in 2015, the hotel sits on the site of a former respiratory health clinic (now closed). Lovely grounds and main building, which includes a family pool, rooftop pool, restored church (converted into a party hall), and neatly manicured gardens. The guest rooms themselves are sparsely decorated, but clean. Excellent buffet breakfast (the best of our trip). The downside of this property is that you must take a boat from St Markâ€™s Square to reach it (20 min each way).  Boat service is frequent, and free, but you cannot just "go back to your hotel" to change. Trips must be carefully planned.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 14, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor.
