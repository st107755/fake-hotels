The hotel is beautiful although the buildings are enormous. The bedrooms are well appointed, the staff is caring but it feels a little superficial by European standards.  The most disappointing is clearly the food. Fatty, tasteless and aceptised. It is a shame considering Italian gastronomy! At our arrival the guest relation told us the hotel was proud of the food quality so we decided to have dinner the first night on the roof top terrace and booked the Michelin Star table for the second night. Obviously we were disappointed by the quality and recipes. The breakfast was the same so we canceled the rest and enjoyed amazing food in Venice.
