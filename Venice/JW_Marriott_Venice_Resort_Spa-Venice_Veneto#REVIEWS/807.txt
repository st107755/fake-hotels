We stayed in a spacious Junior Suite for three nights. We enjoyed this hotel and being able to escape the crowds of Venice. This hotel is on it's very own island with beautiful grounds to walk or bike around. They have a free shuttle boat to and from Piazza San Marco several times a day.  It's really easy to go back and forth, the ride has nice views and is relaxing. I really enjoyed being able to relax at the hotel as well as having easy access to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 4, 2016Dear Gator544, thanks for your positive review.

Many of our guests comment on the spectacular view that you get as you approach San Marco’s Square by boat – it is definitely photo-worthy! Plus, with complimentary Wi-Fi on our boats, it is easy to share your beautiful pictures with friends and family on social media.
