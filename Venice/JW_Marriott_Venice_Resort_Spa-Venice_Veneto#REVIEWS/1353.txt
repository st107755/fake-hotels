We - a family of nine ages 23-84- just departed the resort and our stay was perfect.  The rooms are clean and spacious.  The staff is kind and helpful. The breakfast delicious.  We had 2 king suites and 2 smaller rooms.  The suites have fabulous soaking tub and large decks for morning coffee. The beds are comfortable. You do need an engineering degree to operate the lights and water but a minor inconvenience.  There is a generous workout area and 2 decent sized pools.  It was cool so we were the only guests in the pool which are ok for laps. The roof top dining was delicious and the nicely accommodated allergies. The service great and the views spectacular. We enjoyed being away from the heart of Venice and the chaos of the city. The shuttle service was punctual and efficient. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
