Wow, this hotel is absolutely amazing.Situated about twenty minutes from Venice by Boat Taxi it is on its own island. Its quite something when you arrive by Boat and are taken straight into the hotel lobby. I visited with a group of 20 and we were all looked after. The food is out of this world. We had a salad lunch and lots of Prosecco then cocktails and a delicious meal on the roof top restaurant. All the staff are wonderful but Gabriele & Gianfranco were very special. I would definitely love to go back to this place sometime.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 15, 2016Dear Ian D, thanks for your review.
