Although the hotel is twenty minutes by hotel boat from S Marc s Square, it is on a quiet, green wooded island with extensive grounds and two beautiful pools which we all enjoyed. At the end of August, Venice was teeming and a hot thirty plus degrees. We visited the hotel with our son,wife and two young boys. We all enjoyed the facilities, the friendly staff and the beautiful roof top bar and restaurant with Panoramic views over Venice and the lagoon. The steak we ate one night in this restaurant was the best we have eaten outside of Australia or Argentina and warranted its price.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 9, 2015Dear Judith,  How lovely it was to read your review of our JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa!
