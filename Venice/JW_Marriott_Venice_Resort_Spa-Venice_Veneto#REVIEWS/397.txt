AWESOME!!!  The best of all my hotel experiences.  For one thing, it passed my white glove antibacterial wipe test.  It was very clean and beautiful.  I loved this Marriott.  I didn't want to leave.  It was pretty cool driving up to the James Bond Dock when you arrived via water taxi.  It was the all time best!  The Michelin restaurant on the property was the best food and presentation I've ever experienced and I have traveled all over the world!!!  Thank you JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa. The Spa was second to none!!!  I had the best massage ever!!!  That I do not find.   I have had many massages and I'm hard to please because I am a licensed massage therapist, but Silvia was the best EVER!!!  THANK YOU!!!Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 20, 2017Dear ohhotdamn2015, thanks for your wonderful feedback. We appreciate your kind comments about our clean and beautiful resort, delicious food and amazing spa.  I am delighted to hear that you enjoyed our GOCO Spa. It is such a wonderful experience and you can spend a whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
