I stayed in this hotel in June 2017, it was very magical on its own private island. I stayed in the la Residenza suite which had a very private villa feel, I would recommend it as its a few minutes away from the main building with private check in. The staff were very professional and friendly. Hotel pool was one of the best points, you have an amazing 360 view of Venice. One of the most beautiful views of Venice I think you can get. The shuttle boat to Venice was also very fun to take, feels like something out of a James Bond movie and has even USB charging points. The breakfast was of good quality. I would come again to visit in the future.Read moreDate of stay: July 20172 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
