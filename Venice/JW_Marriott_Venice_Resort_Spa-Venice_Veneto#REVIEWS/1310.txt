I have never been happier being a Platinum Elite Marriott member! I have never felt that appreciated like I did at JW Marriott Venice Resort and Spa. That was saying a lot!  We had a long journey with various mishaps from Milan to Venice. When we arrived at the hotel after a 20 minute shuttle boat ride from Piazza San Marco, I have never been happier. The sign and building outside the boat dock was so small. Really, I didn't know what to expect as I thought that was the entrance. Turned out, it was just a receiving area. Once you were out of the small building acting as foyer, you'd see the grand hotel behind it. Whoa!  At check in, I was received at the platinum desk and two people were helping me with my check in. They were very nice and personable, making great convo with usâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
