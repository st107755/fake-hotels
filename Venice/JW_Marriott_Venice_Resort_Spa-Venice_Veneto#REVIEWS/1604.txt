This JW just opened in March 2015. There are still a lot of "kinks" to work out yet. The rooms are very nice, but we were moved to 4 different rooms before we got one that was acceptable. They had air conditioning problems, a sweet ant problem in one room's bathroom and an illogical set up of electrical outlets and switches.   What we loved was the ability to get away from the hustle and bustle of Venice and get some peace and quiet. The water taxis were timed beautifully with pick ups and drop offs on a basis of around 4 per hour. The breakfasts were delightful with a lot of choices. The grounds were beautiful. And most of all, the staff was pleasant and very accommodating. I would stay here again just because I know that everyone in this JW wants to please and get it right.
