Been there for 5 days with my wife (honeymoon) and been veeeery amazed about that beautiful and stunning hotel and place. Great rooms, good food at restaurants, well equipped gym, everything u need really. What I love about that place is the privacy you get. Your on your very own island which is only accessible by boots. Very quite, you get away from the rush of the city but still get there comfortable by the privat hotel boat (for free) within 20 min. Will for sure come back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare
