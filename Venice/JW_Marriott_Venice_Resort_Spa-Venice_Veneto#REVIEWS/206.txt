This is my first stay at a JW Marriott and I would love to stay with this brand again!   We stayed in one of the Villas with our two children ages 7 and 8 for two nights and I wished it was longer!  The property is gorgeous and the hotel staff is great!   We were not able to use the rooftop pool, as it is adult only and we were traveling with our kids, but it looked really nice.  We did use the kids pool which was so convenient after a long, HOT day sightseeing in Venice.    I HIGHLY recommend this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
