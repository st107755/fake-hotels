Having a water taxi from the airport took 'forever' but the hotel was really worth the experience. We were part of a large group which may have made the journey more traumatic than enjoyable. On arrival the hotel was extremely efficient despite the large number of people checking in. The room was fabulous however a word of caution, getting out of the bath having had a shower is not easy if you are short!  The water taxis are good and ideal for visiting St Marks Square and general walking around the tourist highlights to see. I would certainly chose to re-visit if I visit Venice in the future. Only ate breakfast which was excellent and offered everything you would expect!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 22, 2016Dear wigglyline, thanks for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our fabulous rooms and excellent breakfast.  We hope that you were able to check out some of the activities that we offer at our resort. When the team and I were organizing the excursions that we wanted to provide our guests, we thought of all the things that would be part of the ultimate travel experience of Italy. From interactive cooking classes with Chef Micki to a tour of a traditional Murano glass-making factory, we wanted to showcase our passion for Italy and highlight some of the wonderful and fascinating aspects of its culture and history.   Thank you for choosing JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
