After spending 2 heavenly week’s tour old world Italy through Rome, Pompei and Tuscany, I was initially a little put off by the modern, stark white resort look of this resort... but that ended 3 min into our check in process when a waiter randomly showed up at the desk w/a tray of sparkling water & cappuccinos!! 2 family pools, tons of kids from all over, lovely families we made friend with, a field full of fun & sporty toys, a great little gym and a fantastic, truly helpful concierge staff (who arranged everything for us)! Yes- go to Venice, but STAY on this island resort and take the boat over - preferably after 5pm when the cruise ship crowds leave. It’s a king’s random - but worth every penny!!
