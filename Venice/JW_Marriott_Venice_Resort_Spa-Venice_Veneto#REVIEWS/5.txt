What a great hotel. Service is incredible, food great, facilities lovely. The room was large and comfortable. Stayed for a long weekend and spent our time wandering around the island, swimming in one of the pools, visiting the well-appointed gym or going to the spa. Oh, and catching the regular boat into Venice (about 20 minutes away). This really is a fantastic way to experience Venice - away from the crowds on your own island but close enough to get there quickly. Spend a day at the spa, treatments very high standard.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
