Located on an island the hotel occupues the whole island. Majestuous construction you arrive to it a In a boat that enters a private harbour and makes you feel like james bond. Everything in the hotel is luxourious. The lanscaping on the island, the fantastic bedrooms, linnens, bathroom! So new so beautiful... the rooftop bar, which offer breathtaking views of the lagoon and sunset...our only concern was staying too far from dowtown Venice ...Marriott has private fast boats running from the hotel to piazza san marco every 30 min until midnight. You can go to venice for the day, just for a walk, even for dinner and a private motor boat will take you back to the hotel. Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
