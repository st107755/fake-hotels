Let me start with the most important feature of this resort--its distance from the city center. The positive is the free shuttle boat to and from San Marco pier. The negative is the 30-minute ride on said shuttle boat. Before deciding to stay here, the question to ask yourself is: if I were trying to see New York City, would I stay in a luxury resort on Long Island, a 30-minute train ride out of Manhattan?

We appreciate your kind comments about our luxurious and gorgeous resort. As you mentioned, our property is unique in the sense that it is located on its own private island, which is only a short boat ride away from Venice proper. Many of our guests tell us that they really enjoy the combination of accessibility to Venice and peace and seclusion that our hotel offers after a full day of sightseeing. Being able to provide this oasis of calm is what makes us special and why many of our guests who are frequent visitors of Venice decide to stay with us time and time again.  Thank you for recommending us and we hope that we can welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again in the future.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
