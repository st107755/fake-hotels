Nice property in a great location. Opened in 2015 and the first JW in Italy. It's Expensive but so are most of the nice hotels in Venice. It is on an Island and you take a boat to get there but that is not unusual here. They have their own free water shuttle. Stayed in the main hotel. Rooms are basic, beds are comfortable. I'm sure the suites and villas offer more luxury. Would choose a suite if I stayed here again. Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
