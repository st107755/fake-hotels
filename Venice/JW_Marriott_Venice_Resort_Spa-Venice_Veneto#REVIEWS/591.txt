We had a great time at this JW Marriott. The staff is friendly, and strived  to make sure we enjoyed our stay. 2 names come to mind Nicola and Pep they both went out of their way to make sure  our family had a great time at the family pool area. Pep also helped us figure out the best way to reach Rome. My only disappointment was the fact that our room was rather small. To be fair, this might be the norm in this area, however we did expect more from a JW Marriott. This was our 3rd JW in less than 3 months. The room situation could not be resolved because the hotel was completely booked.  We would gladly return if we were guaranteed a bigger room or could book a suite.
