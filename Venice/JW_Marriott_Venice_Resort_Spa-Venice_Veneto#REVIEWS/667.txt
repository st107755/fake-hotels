Stayed only one night but really enjoyed the stay. Everything was just perfect and staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooftop pool deck is pretty amazing and relaxing. I would come back anyday. Extremely happy to get a late checkout:)Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 12, 2017Dear eevaa2016, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We appreciate your kind words about our friendly and helpful staff and amazing rooftop pool.  I agree, our Sagra Rooftop restaurant and pool offers one of the best vantage points to admire breathtaking 360-degree views of Venice and the Lagoon. It is also the ideal place to watch the beautiful Venetian sunset. Many guests tell us how much they enjoy spending Happy Hour there while indulging in a glass of prosecco and some tapas from our Cicchetti Menu. It is an experience not to be missed.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
