This was the most amazing hotel we have ever stayed in. When you arrive you feel that you could be in a James Bond movie! The staff were fantastic ranging from boat captain to desk staff to bar and restaurant staff. I cannot believe that anyone could have written some of the previous reviews. Don't believe them!!  The view from the rooftop bar looking over the Venice skyline is just beautiful.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 8, 2015Dear Simon,  We would like to thank you for your feedback.
