Booked to stay at this hotel next week for a surprise for my partners 21st birthday (which the hotel had knowledge of). I had this booked this hotel back in February; everything was planned and paid for. I was emailed on Tuesday stating that my reservation had been cancelled due to 'maintenance' (a week before I was meant to be there). I defiantly will not be staying at a Marriott anytime in the future and advise others not too. The Ca'sagredo hotel (a few minutes from St Marks Square) have been amazing and have saved my surprise from being ruined.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 30, 2016Dear georgiasorrentino, we are very sorry to hear about your cancelled reservation. We would like to extend our most sincere apologies about the inconvenience caused, however please allow me to clarify the situation. As mentioned in previous communications, an urgent repair has been scheduled to take place during the time of your visit. Even though it should only take 48 hours to rectify, the timing is very unfortunate. I personally understand your disappointment and would be as upset if a similar situation happened to me.   Again we very much regret the disruption resulting from this unforeseen event and we hope that you will re-consider staying with us in the future.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
