Stayed for the opening weekend of the Biennale. A pleasant 20 minute boat ride from St Mark's. We stayed in a junior suite which was well appointed with lovely views across their gardens.  Can't believe they don't include room wifi at their room rates. The hotel has only been open for a few weeks and you could tell. Their restaurant Sagra was the only one open and were definitely having teething problems - overpriced and inconsistent food. However, the rooftop pool and deck area with it's sweeping views across the lagoon to Venice was a great place to unwind and have a drink.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
