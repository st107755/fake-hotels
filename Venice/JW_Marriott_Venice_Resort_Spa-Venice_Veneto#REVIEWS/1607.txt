I loved everything about this hotel.  The staff was outstanding.  When we experienced problems with the air conditioning in our room, we were quickly moved to another room.  The roof top bar and pool setting with an amazing view of Venice is spectacular.  Great service at the bar, but really a treat to relax by and swim in the pool.  Our suite was spacious and I loved the simplicity of the design.  Everything high end (great mattress).  I felt the simplicity of the room let your eyes be drawn to the beautiful view out your windows.  The hotel is a 20 minute water taxi ride from St. Mark's Square.  Initially concerned this could be an inconvenience, I quickly fell in love with the boat ride.  Venice is bursting with tourists.  It was so nice to escape to the quiet of the islandâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 26, 2015Dear Ruth Ann,  Thank you for such a nice review!
