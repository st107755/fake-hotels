Currently staying at this property with family.  I was excited that we were able to use points for this reservation as we are a family of three that use Marriotts globally and the Marriott credit card.  I prefer to stay at JW's knowing that its sometimes better than the Ritz Carltons that are often in the same city.  Venice, however, only has the JW.    Checking into the hotel is unique in that you arrive by boat into a private area.  This was really cool to experience but the boat ride to that area came with much added expense.  There are other ways to reach the hotel cheaper, but we were on a short time schedule and it did not bother us to pay the additional amount.  There was not a dedicated checkin for Elite members of Marriotts rewards program.. which I thought was strange.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 25, 2017Dear tlabossiere, thank you for taking the time to write a review while you are still at our resort.
