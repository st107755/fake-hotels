A great place to base yourself whilst in Venice in the heat of the summer, a great escape from the crowds. Very effecient water taxi shuttle to St Mark's Square - but allow yourselves plenty of time as waterways very busy in Summer can can be slow. The spa is amazing. Hotel very spacious and good restaurant options. Lovely kids club - great staff who get the kids swimming and doing plenty of outdoors activities. We still fitted in plenty of sightseeing but this resort gives you the best of both worlds - and a wonderful escape from the heat of the city.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 24, 2015Dear Helen,  We would like to thank you for your feedback.
