We arrived at 8:30am after an overnight flight from Toronto, Canada.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The normal check-in is 3pm, but they had our room ready before lunch time.  The hotel has frequent, complimentary water taxi service to San Marco Island which docked close to St.Mark's Square.  The hotel has a full American breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 3, 2016Dear Edward M, thanks for writing a review.
