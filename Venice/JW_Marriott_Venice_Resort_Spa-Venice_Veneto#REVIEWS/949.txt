I have stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world and the Venice Marriott Resort is one of the very best. The rooms, service, food, views - everything was faultless. Literally faultless. The staff-guest ratio is extremely high and there always seems to be a member of staff there to help, advise or serve. Views from the rooftop pool, over the lagoon towards Venice are unique and breathtaking. The free hotel launch takes you to and from the mainland in style every 30 minutes. I will go back to this resort hotel time and time again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 24, 2016Dear Coconutmatting, we are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time at our magical Isola delle Rose. It means a lot to us to hear you say that our rooms, customer service, food and views are faultless.  We hope that you were able to check out some of the activities that we offer at our resort. When the team and I were organizing the excursions that we wanted to provide our guests, we thought of all the things that would be part of the ultimate travel experience of Italy. From interactive cooking classes with Chef Micki to a tour of a traditional Murano glass-making factory, we wanted to showcase our passion for Italy and highlight some of the wonderful and fascinating aspects of its culture and history.   Thank you for choosing JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
