Spent two nights here while visiting Venice.  Amazing property great for exploring and great for families.  A couple tips:  Avoid the "Family Pool" - its at the rear of the property and we enjoyed the views from the rooftop Infinity Pool and Deck with several other families.  Also, shuttle boats between JW and St. Mark's square run mostly every 30 minutes, and the ride can take up to that long so plan accordingly.  The hotel staff was mostly friendly although pool attendants and bar staff could stand a refresher on customer service and courtesy.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 2, 2015Dear Paul,  Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor.
