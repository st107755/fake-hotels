The location and views are breathtaking. The facilities are immaculate. The service is wonderful and the staff are attentive, polite and professional. The food is delicious and the herb garden is such a nice and unexpected surprise! I don't have one negative thing to say and I look very much forward to another visit. Also, shout out to Fabio who attended the desk and kept us entertained while we waited for the hotel shuttle to take us to the main island. And, Patricia, my wonderful masseuse who did an excellent job.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 12, 2017Dear MarchMai, thank you for taking the time to write a review.
