Pricey...but a perfect getaway. The hotel is located on a private island that is only accessible via the hotel boat (shuttle that runs every 30 minutes to/from San Marco Square area) or private water taxi. We coordinated the arrival transportation from the airport ahead of time through the hotel concierge to make the trip smoother.   Enjoy the wonderful sights that Venice has to offer and then retire to a more relaxed and comfortable setting at the hotel property.   Service was excellent!
