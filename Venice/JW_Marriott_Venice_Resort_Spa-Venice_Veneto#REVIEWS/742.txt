Such a beautiful island and hotel. From arrival in a private water taxi, a seamless check in (and thank you Teresa for the upgrade and welcome) wonderful food and service in the restaurant upstairs, fabulous infinity pool (heated) and stunning views over Venice from the rooftop bar- thank you to all staff here for making our stay unforgettable. Our room (25) was a beautiful serene space with the most comfortable bath and beautiful marble bathroom. Easy ride into Venice with the shuttle boat every 30 mins ensured our days and evenings out in Venice itself to be very enjoyable. Thank you to Valentina too for her hospitality on check out. The concierge Victorio was incredibly helpful throughout. We will be back!

We are grateful for your generous comments about our beautiful island, wonderful food, stunning views and helpful staff.  Our Isola delle Rose – Island of Roses – has a rich history. Its position, halfway between the lagoon and sea, has given the island a special microclimate, which has encouraged the growth of plants and trees rare in Venice and inspired the establishment of a clinic of respiratory ailments at the beginning of the 20th century. We are proud of the historical roots of our private island and love to share the beauty of our grounds with our guests.  Thanks for choosing the JW Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
