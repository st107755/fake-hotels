We took a family trip to Italy;  second stop was in Venice.  The entire family really enjoyed this hotel.  Being on a private island was fantastic;  the hotel and grounds were beautiful.  There is a regular ferry (run by Marriott) across to San Marcos Square.  The hotel staff was incredible as well!  Paulo at breakfast was tremendous - so helpful and has a great personality.  Matteo at the bar/lunch area was constantly making sure customers were taken care of, and our kids attended kids club - they absolutely loved Sara!  Don't miss the wine tasting event either - Simone was a lot of fun and extremely knowledgeable.  This hotel is one I/we would highly recommend!Read moreHelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 20, 2017Dear KevinCP51, thank you for your review.
