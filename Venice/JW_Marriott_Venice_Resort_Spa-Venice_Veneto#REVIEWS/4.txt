If you like being isolated from your vacation destination, then this is the hotel for you. This hotel and island are beautiful, full stop. But it takes about 20 to 25 minutes via boat to reach the main section of Venice--perhaps that is the charm for some. My friends and I discovered this was not really our scene. Restaurant options are limited. There are only two open for dinner and reservations are recommended for both. There is a cafe, which sells coffee and some snacks, but that is it for food. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would elect to stay in the main section again before choosing this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019ValueServiceSleep QualityRoom Tip: First floor rooms have small patios.See more room tips1 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from AndreaVieites, Rooms Division Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Feb 12, 2020Dear Radnatty,  Thank you for sharing your valued feedback about your recent stay at our JW Marriott Venice.
