From the moment we arrived it was absolutely the best service! I've been in Italy for 9 days and this is my tail end of our trip... Needless to say, nothing compares to this hotel.  The grounds are breathtaking!! Olive trees, white roses and jasmine, mixed with the ocean is truly incredible.  Sitting on its own island, you can not compare. Elisa at the restaurant on the 4th floor was great, she recommended great dishes, and embodied the JW Marriott service! We can not wait to come back!

We really appreciate your kind words about our fantastic customer service and breathtaking grounds.  Our Isola delle Rose – Island of Roses – has a rich history. Its position, halfway between the lagoon and sea, has given the island a special microclimate, which has encouraged the growth of plants and trees rare in Venice and inspired the establishment of a clinic of respiratory ailments at the beginning of the 20th century. We are proud of the historical roots of our private island and love to share the beauty of our grounds with our guests.  Thanks for choosing the JW Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
