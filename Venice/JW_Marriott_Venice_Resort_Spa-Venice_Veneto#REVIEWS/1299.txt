Like many other reviewers said, the hotel is on it's own private island which gives you privacy and serenity away from the crowds in Venice.  Taking the hotel provided shuttle boat back and forth to the city is easy and convenient. Rooms and service were first class.  First time solo travelers plan for a private water taxi to the island on arrival.  Depending on where you pick it up (e.g. Airport, etc) the ride can cost from 100 to 200 euros so be prepared.  Overall a great place and location.  Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Mar 20, 2016Dear ArizonaFlyer, thank you so much for your positive review.

It is an incredible experience â€“ you get the chance to meet an experienced lace maker, who has been creating her own beautiful designs for more than 65 years at her workshop on the charming island of Burano.
