Great place to stay in Venice if you have few days (not centrally located) and your aim is to visit and relax. All facilities are great, especially the infinity pool. It was nice to walk around the island at night. Breakfast is good and generous. There is a lack of ambiance at the Cucina and Dopolavoro restaurants; they could do something on lightening and music. But dinner at Sagra is nice with the sunset & moonrise. Take the complimentary trip to Murano if you wish to do a tour of water taxi without having to pay for it. Conciergerie could be improved (I would expect better recommandations on restaurants and shopping; their recommendations are very conservative and quite pricy).Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 9, 2015Dear Madam,  We would like to thank you for your detailed feedback.
