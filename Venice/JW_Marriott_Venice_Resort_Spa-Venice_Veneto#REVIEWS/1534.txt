First of all let me apologize as unfortunately it sounds we haven't encountered your expectations despite the positive comments on our great food and genuine care of our staff.

We have a team of engineers that are fixing the problem and where is needed we have purchased a number of portable units to place in the hot rooms. We clearly understand that this is not pleasant but I would like to reassure you that soon this issue will be fixed completely. As an aggravation Europe reached a record heat over the last few weeks. We are really sorry to hear that beside the AC issue other problems have occurred. We have taken notes on your comments on the cleanliness of the room and public areas and also on your comments on the problems experienced at check out. As among negative comments there were a few positives we hope you give us a second chance and you will revisit in the future. We really want to turn into your "best marriott experience".
