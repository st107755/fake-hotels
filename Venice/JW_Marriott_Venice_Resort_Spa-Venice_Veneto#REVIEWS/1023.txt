We appreciate your kind comments about our wonderful views, spectacular grounds, good food and friendly and helpful staff. We are delighted that you enjoyed your one-night stay with us before embarking on your cruise.  I think that Venice is an ideal location to establish a base for an Italian or European trip. Our airport is the third biggest in the country with connections to almost every single cosmopolitan city in the world and direct flights to several cities in Europe. Furthermore, the train system can take you to Milan, Rome, Florence or even as south as Napoli.

Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
