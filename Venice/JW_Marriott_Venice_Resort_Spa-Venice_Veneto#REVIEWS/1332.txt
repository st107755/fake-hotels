I would say that this is the best place to stay in Venice if you can afford it even though have a bit of air conditioning problem (which I hope will be solved during the winter time closure). This is an Oasis in Venice surrounded by water and having breeze in the nights and days and it has no bad smell which you may notice in the city. Villas are the best to stay at as they have their own air conditioning system separate from the main building and they are very cosy in addition to that they have a small fenced area each with deck chairs. Make sure to visit Dopalavoro restaurant to learn one of the highest levels of quisine.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
