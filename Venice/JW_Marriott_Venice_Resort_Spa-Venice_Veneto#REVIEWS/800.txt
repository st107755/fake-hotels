We stayed there for 2 nights. The location is magical, the room it was clean, quiet with a very nice interiors. The staff on the reception was very professional and prepared. The  "swimming pool" is very small, I would not even call swimming pool.The view it's fantastic if you manage to grab a place. The surrounding space it's very very limited. The food, breakfast, all very good, but the service need to improve. Perfect location, away from tourists but still very central.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 10, 2016Dear pmdc, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our magical location, clean rooms, professional staff, fantastic views and good breakfast.  The next time you stay with us we hope that you will have the chance to check out some of the activities and excursions that we offer at our resort such as our Sapori Cooking Academy, which is a big hit with our guests. The morning program we offer is such an unforgettable experience. The day starts off with meeting Chef Micki and travelling together via private water taxi to the colorful Rialto Market. He helps you choose the freshest ingredients to take back to the resort where he teaches how to prepare delicious dishes following the Venetian culinary tradition. Plus, you get to enjoy the lunch that you helped prepare. It is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the local culture â€“ I highly recommend it.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
