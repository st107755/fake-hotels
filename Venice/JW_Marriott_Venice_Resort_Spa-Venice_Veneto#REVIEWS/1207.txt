I have to say that I travel quite a lot and I have stayed at a number of hotels for pleasure and business. I don't know how but I always have high expectations and therefore I think I'm hard to please but on this occasion, the JW Marriott Venice totally exceeded my expectations. The hotel has everything you need. The grounds surrounding the hotel make it ideal to breakaway from the city of Venice.  The pool overlooking Venice just elevates the experience of an affinity pool.  I would also like to recognize Gianfranco from Cucina! He anticipated everything we wanted! It's hard to find great service but he went above and beyond his duties. His attitude and desire to please was outstanding. He's certainly an asset to JW!  We will be back! Thank you for a great stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
