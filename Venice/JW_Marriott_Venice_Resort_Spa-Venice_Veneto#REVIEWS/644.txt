Venice is a beautiful but very chaotic city: JWMarriot is the hotel where really you can relax after visiting the city, its palaces, its wonderful churches, romantic bridges, historic squares and unique artistic works. The hotel is indeed located in an isolated and beautiful island (15 minutes from San Marco Giardinetti dock by boat).  Staff is joung but extremely attentive and polite, although sometimes they can not speak Italian properly. High quality food and beverage. High comfortable rooms and bed. SPA and pool and gym well equiped in a relaxing atmosphere. Conference center extremely comfortable and flexible.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 21, 2017Dear AlessandraMatilde67, thank you so much for taking the time to write a review. We are grateful for your generous comments about our beautiful island, attentive and polite staff, comfortable rooms and high quality culinary program.  As you mentioned, we believe having the ability to escape Veniceâ€™s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit, our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
