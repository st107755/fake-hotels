Beautiful hotel on private island. Free shuttle boat  to St Marks area of Venice. Boat runs every 30 minutes. Hotel also offers morning shuttles to bus/train station. If you are looking for a quiet escape from the crowds and hectic environment of mainland Venice, then this hotel is for you. If you enjoy being in the middle of everything, stay in a hotel in the main area of Venice. The breakfast buffet was included with the conference, but normally costs extra.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 22, 2017Dear Cookie8186, thanks for your review.
