Our room was amazingly large. Everything was brand new and shiny and nothing was out of place. The family pool is great and even though the resort was packed, it didn't feel packed. Would come back anytime!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 4, 2016Dear Kai M, thanks for your positive review. We appreciate your kind feedback about our fabulous resort, large rooms and great family pool.  Next time you visit us, you should check out our Squero Tramontin tour to see how gondolas are made. This exclusive excursion via water taxi takes JW guests to the magical and authentic place where gondolas are built and repaired. It is an excursion that I highly recommend to our guests â€“ there is only one place like this in Venice.  Thank you for choosing to stay at our Isola delle Rose and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
