Great hotel, great service, breathtaking location.  Loved this hotel.  Only way to get there is for Saint Marks Square via the hotelâ€™s water taxi. Otherwise you have to take an expensive private water taxi. Beautiful grounds. Spent two nights there and toured Venice most of the time. Staff was extremely accommodatingRead moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
