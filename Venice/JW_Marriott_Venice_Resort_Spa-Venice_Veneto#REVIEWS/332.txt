We spent 5 nights beginning May 17th at this great property!   Before planning this trip I was concerned about its private island location- but boy, was that  a waste of brain cells.  I have stayed over 1800 nights at Marriott and associated properties and am a lifetime Platinum member.  The room was huge by Europe standards, modern, spotless and  extremely well appointed. The hotel is on its own island, with a hotel, lovely spa( we did not use), parks, walking and biking paths, a church, pools, soccer field (OK, football to you Europeans) several restaurants and event/convention facilities. The fine restaurant has a large garden where they grow much of the herbs, vegetables and fruit that is served. It was very enjoyable to walk through these gardens where everything isâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
