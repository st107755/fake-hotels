Over the past few years we have begun to holiday well (!) and have stayed in a number of lovely properties (Banyan Tree, Interconti etc) in Asia and the US. Without any doubt this hotel is up there with the best of them.   Firstly, the setting - a private island just 20mins away from San Marco with a smart ferry that leaves every 30mins with more than enough room for everyone. The island itself is relatively large (for Venice) with an abundance of lush green grass and white stone. Beautifully restored buildings frame the scene resulting in an almost surreal ambience and just 20 mins from frenetic Venice!   Room - we stayed in a lovely bungalow with (small) pool looking over the lagoon (albeit from a distance). The room was delightful, the level of fittings as good as we've seen.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 8, 2016Dear BenRog39, thanks for your review.
