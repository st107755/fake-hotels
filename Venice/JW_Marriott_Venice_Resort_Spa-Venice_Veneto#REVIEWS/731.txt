This is an enchanting, peaceful island with all the first class amenities of top notch five star hotels. On arrival we were upgraded to Le Massionette - modern double story units set in an olive grove away from the central hotel. But close to Michelen star dining and magical heated, salinated swimming pool. The service, the food, the ambience and the simple pleasure and indulgence of being in this wonderful part of the world was outstanding. We would go back again in a heart beat! It was a holiday in itself without even stepping into Venice itself.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 18, 2017Dear Nicky W, thanks for your wonderful feedback about our magical Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your generous comments about our enchanting and peaceful island, first-class amenities, outstanding service and delicious food.  We hope that you were able to check out Dispensa during your stay with us. One of the best things about living in Italy is being able to travel its amazing cities and visit the local markets. The inspiration behind the new concept for Dispensa was our desire to bring all the wonderful and traditional products that you would find in any Italian regional market to our guests. We offer a mouthwatering and affordable selection of salami, prosciutto, cheeses and other delicious delicacies from all over Italy. We also feature our own Olive Oil, made from the olive trees that grow on our property. These can be purchased in convenient travel size bottles so that guests can bring home a unique memento of their stay with us.
