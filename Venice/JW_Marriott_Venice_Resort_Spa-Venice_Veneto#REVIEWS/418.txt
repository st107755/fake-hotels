We stayed in the JW Marriott Venice for 4 nights as a family of 4 and are long-standing Marriott rewards members.

We appreciate all your kind comments about our amazing sanctuary.   We believe having the ability to escape Venice’s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit, our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants.

All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
