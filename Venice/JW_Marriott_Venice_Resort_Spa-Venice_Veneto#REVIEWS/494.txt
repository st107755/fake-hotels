Overall the resort is wonderful.  You just need to know some thing going in to avoid unpleasant surprises.    Food Prices - the restaurant prices are very high, in many cases higher than is reasonable.  In our case we spent 5 days there without purchasing a single meal from the hotel.  We simply self-catered our brunches and snacks and had dinner each night in Venice.  The hotel will empty the mini-bar fridge upon request though note it is very small.  Prices in the markets in Venice are reasonable enough (there is a "Coop" near the Rialto bridge that worked well for us) where we picked up a loaf of good bread, a quarter kilo of parm, small bottle of spicy olive oil, balsamic, tomatoes, water, Chianti, etc. If you want to eat on the island here is a rundown: - Sagra is casualâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 31, 2017Dear Dave-from-Boston-USA, thank you for your detailed review. We appreciate your generous comments about our wonderful resort, excellent staff, reliable shuttle service and family-friendly facilities.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our property provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very kids-friendly, with a family pool, interactive water fountain, playground as well as a fun Adventure Park.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
