We stayed in Venice for 3 days.  If you want to get out of the crowds, definitely consider the JW.  It is on its own island and has a boat shuttle into St. Mark's square.  There on the  island you can have a stroll, enjoy the great spa, etc...    They treated us very well and as a platinum, though no providing breakfast, they did provide a discount on an upgraded room which we enjoyed!  We commend this to you and will visit them again the next time we are in the area.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 3, 2016Dear stephenpugh, thanks so much for your review. We are glad to hear that you had a wonderful stay at our magical Isola delle Rose.  I hope you had the chance to take part in on our Olive Oil Tasting tour during your stay with us. We love explaining to our guests the history of our 100 olive trees and how they grow. We also showcase different olive oils, including our own which is the only one produced in Venice and exclusively served at our Dopolavoro Dining Room.   Thank you for choosing Marriott and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
