The hotel is situated on a small Island near Venice. The island itself is very well maintained and a wonderful place if you would like to escape the crowded city center. The hotellobby is very inviting and we were greeted by very attentive and friendly staff members. The rooms are furnished in a very tasteful manner. The breakfast buffet offers a great choice of food items and leaves nothing to be desired.  We ate at the italian tapas place up on the roof top - it was delicious!  Overall we had a wonderful stay, in wonderful location being spoilt by wonderful staff!Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
