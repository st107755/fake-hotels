This was a fabulous place to stay during our short trip to Venice.Based on it's own private island with stunning views especially from the rooftop.Staff are very welcoming and the quiet,relaxed atmosphere makes this a great haven from the heat and crowds  of Venice which is only a short boat ride away.The only downside ,if it wasn't so expensive to dine in ,you might be tempted to remain on the island your entire stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 4, 2016Dear Anar S, thanks for writing a review. We are grateful for your kind comments about our beautiful island, stunning views, welcoming staff and relaxed atmosphere.  I am also delighted to hear that you enjoyed the spectacular views from our rooptop pool and restaurant. You might be interested to hear that besides the regular menu, we also offer a special menu from the Cicchetti Bar, which are Venetian-style tapas. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden. One of my favorite dining experiences is enjoying these Venetian-style tapas while overlooking the dramatic skyline of the Lagoon during sunset at our rooftop.   Thank you for choosing to stay at our magical Isola delle Rose and we hope to welcome you back again very soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
