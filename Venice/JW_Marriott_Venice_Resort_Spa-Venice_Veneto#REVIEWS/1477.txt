I stayed at the JW Marriott Venice with 5 friends; in total we had 3 rooms. The whole experience was amazing!   We had a private taxi picking us up from the airport (pre ordered via the concierge) – this turned out to be a great idea as we saved time and did not have to cross Venice during rush hour.  The arrival at the hotel is breath taking. The island is absolutely fantastic and the staff waiting for us made it even better – almost like a movie.  The rooms were incredible!  The materials and the decoration are held at a very high standard and the beds were super comfortable.  The amenities are top of the market and absolutely nothing was missing. It was just perfect!  Breakfast was a little bit crowded but despite that the food was great. I recommend going a little bit early…Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 29, 2015Dear André,  We would like to thank you for your feedback.
