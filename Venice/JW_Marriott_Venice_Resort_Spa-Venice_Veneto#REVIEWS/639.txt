I am a 12 year old girl writing this review. My family and I visited Venice like a week ago and we loved it. The people who work at this Marriott are very nice and treat you respectfully. Not only is their restaurant good, their rooftop pool and family pool are amazing! We spent hours swimming. This hotel is on another island than Venice, so it gives your stay a relaxing touch. The room we were upgraded to had a private pool and two floors. My dad is a platinum premier, so they upgraded us when we arrived! I'm assuming all of the rooms are very nice and relaxing. Enjoy your stay!Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 25, 2017Dear 6588Susan, thank you for taking the time to write a review! We appreciate your kind comments about our nice and respectful staff, good restaurants and relaxing rooms.  As you probably noticed, we have expanded our Family Pool to include an interactive water fountain where kids can play and use their imagination to create their own inventions with super-sized waterproof foam bricks. The fountain is suited for children of all ages and is a fantastic addition to our kids-friendly area, which features a playground and Adventure Park as well. I am glad you had a great time!  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
