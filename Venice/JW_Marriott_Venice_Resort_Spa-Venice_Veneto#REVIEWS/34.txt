Although I come to Venice 2-3 times a year for work, I’ve never stayed off one of the main islands. Was a bit concerned about the boat to/from here, but it all worked seamlessly and once on the private island, you feel like you’re on your own oasis. The staff are super friendly and make you feel inordinately welcome. Just one tip - keep the windows closed at night- the mosquitoes are a terror even in Oct.!Read moreDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
