We’ve just returned from a 3 night stay with extended family. The location and surroundings are beautiful and the staff go out of their way to be attentive and friendly.

Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our property provides the perfect respite.
