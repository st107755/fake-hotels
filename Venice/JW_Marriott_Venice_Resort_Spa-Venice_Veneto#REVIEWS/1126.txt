I have stayed in a lot of hotels for business and lesire and I can honestly say that this one is up there amongst the top three. It is an oasis of tranquillity away from the hustle and bustle of Venice. The environment is beautiful, it lives up to the island name of 'roses'. We stayed in the olive grove area and walked a few times in the grounds. Excellent food, much grown locally. But ehat makes it so special are the staff. Every one without exception. They must have great recruitment practices. I arrived late at night tired and dont remember the lovely people who looked after us. But s special mention to Alexandra on reception and Cosmin by the boat when we left. Molto grazie, tutti!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 10, 2016Dear GreedyGourmet, thanks so much for writing a review. We appreciate your generous comments about our beautiful property, excellent food and lovely staff.  I agree with your sentiment about our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort. Some guests even tell us that on some days they donâ€™t leave our island!  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
