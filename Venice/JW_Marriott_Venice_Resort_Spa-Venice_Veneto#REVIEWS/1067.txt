The JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa was lovely. The grounds were breathtaking, the staff went above & beyond to be friendly, helpful & kind. The rooftop infinity pool that looks over the water is just amazing. The breakfast was the biggest spread of local, delicious fare from our entire Europe trip. Being on your own island helped us escape from the busy, tourist feel of Venice. We loved our stay here & would highly recommend it to couples who want a retreat or families.

We appreciate your kind comments about our lovely resort, breathtaking grounds, delicious food and friendly and helpful staff.  Did you have the chance to explore our private island by bicycle? One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our historical gardens. It really is a fun and memorable way to enjoy our Isola delle Rose.  Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
