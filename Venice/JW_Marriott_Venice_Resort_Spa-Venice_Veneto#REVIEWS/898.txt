Truly an amazing resort! Will go back in a heartbeat! Do treat yourself to a water taxi upon arrival from the airport, it's a super fun way to arrive. My son's 11&12 had a great time at the family pool. They love football and played on the football pitch.

We appreciate your kind comments about our amazing resort and family-friendly atmosphere.  We also hope that your children had the chance to check out our Kids Club. When the team and I were brainstorming the activities for the Kids Club program, we wanted to offer something that would incorporate aspects of Italian culture so that the children would get to know the history and traditions of our beautiful country. Some of the activities that we are proud to offer families include Italian language lessons, creating and painting your own mini gondola and making Venetian masks.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
