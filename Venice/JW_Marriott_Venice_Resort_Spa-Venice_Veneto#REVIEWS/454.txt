On its own island, it was a wonderful experience to pull into checkin via Water Taxi. The hotel is definitely high class and the staff go out of there way to make you comfortable. You can't walk 5 ft without someone ensuring your needs are met. We had a jr suite which was absolutely spectacular (although a little expensive). Had dinner in their rooftop restaurant. Again, spectacular albeit expensive. We splurged here and glad we did on our last few nights in Italy. One exquisite hotel to be sure!Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 22, 2017Dear Agoura0, thanks for taking the time to write a review.
