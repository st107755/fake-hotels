The JW offers the best of both a relaxing resort with 5 stars service and the pleasure of being a 20 minutes boat ride away from one of the worldâ€™s most beautiful and magical cities.  We have been to this resort twice and it does not disappoint. Enjoy a wonderful breakfast at the Cucina with a great staff, enjoy a walk in the park setting, spend some time lounging at the pool, take the comfortable shuttle into San Marco for sightseeing, return to the hotel after dinner and some shopping and stop in the delightful lobby bar before retiring.  So great!,Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
