This hotel exceeded our expectations. It is truly magical. The staff were outstanding - all of them were kind, happy, knowledgeable  and always on hand to help. The infinty pool views were spectactular and watching the sunset from the Saga bar across to the Venice skyine was breathtaking. They even have a fabulous  seperate pool/play area for children as we have a 1 year old son with us. Aside from our honeymoon this was the best hotel we have ever stayed in for overall experience. We stayed in a deluxe room and it was clean, spacious and the bed was so comfy. I can't wait to go back. sHOULD BE ON EVERYONE'S BUCKETLIST! I would highly recommend getting a private water taxi there to add to the whole experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 5, 2017Dear Georgina Z, thank you so much for your generous comments. We are delighted to hear that our resort exceeded all your expectations. We appreciate your generous comments about our spectacular views, spacious rooms and fabulous facilities.  I am also glad to hear that your one-year old son enjoyed his stay with us. Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our property provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very kids-friendly, with a family pool, interactive water fountain, playground as well as a fun Adventure Park.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
