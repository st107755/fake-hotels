Long overdue review! We stayed during our honeymoon in September 2016.  We stayed in one of the resort's villlas and WOW! The room was just astonishing! We spent a lot of time in the plunge pool when we should have been exploring Venice. Haha!  The staff went above and beyond to make our stay great, and we loved that we could get an American style breakfast (after 2 weeks in Italy it was the one thing we really missed).  I recommend the hotel's tour of Murano, it was a great excursion.  The one down side was rushing to get the last boat back to the hotel from Venice at the end of the night. We found ourselves running to the dock on more than one occasion! Would definitely return to this beautiful hotel!
