We had just 2 days in Venice before a cruise and enjoyed the serenity and beauty of this resort. Gabriele made good suggestions (walk through the romantic garden to dinner) and remembered us every time we saw him.  All staff were pleasant and professional. My spouse rode in the elevator with chef Micki Milan, who gave him his business card and said to look him up on our next visit. Dinner at Dopolavoro was super special: an attentive wait staff, lots of beautiful and delicious "surprises" to eat and an imaginative menu. We have stayed in many  first-class resorts throughout the world; this one is our all-time favorite.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 24, 2017Dear mikemarsha, thanks for your review.
