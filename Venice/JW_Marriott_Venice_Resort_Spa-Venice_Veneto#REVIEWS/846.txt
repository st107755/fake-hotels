From the moment you approach the hotel by water--with its grandiose entry--walk in and check in with one of the front desk attendants, you know its going to be a great stay! We loved everything about it from the secluded location--away from the hustle and bustle of Venice in the summer--to the spacious rooms, great restaurants and amazing on site cooking school. It is, for sure, the best JW Marriott we've ever stayed in! My whole family loved this hotel and will be back for sure!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 19, 2016Dear murosMiami_FL, thanks for all your positive feedback. We are delighted to hear that you loved our secluded location, spacious rooms, great restaurants and amazing Sapori Cooking Academy.  What we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to San Marco Square means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style. I am so happy to hear that you and your family loved our resort.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you and your family back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
