I have visited this resort in this private island for one night! It was amazing as an environement, but i think that when you pay €399 per night for a double room at least you have to get free wifi. The wifi was not free (thanks to a polite lady I subscribed to Marriot group so that i can have free access without paying the €15), breakfast was so included in the price (it was extra €34), not even the bike rental in the island (€10)! The Spa has also an amazing swimming pool but in order to gain some hours acceas you had to pay €35! It is not only about the high price, but the feeling that you have to pay anything! Overall, it is a great resort and an amazing destination in Venice!
