From the minute you arrive via water taxi or the hotel shuttle, the property is impressive.  A modern building with large rooms, amazing bathroom (big tub, separate shower, robes, quality amenities).  Roof top bar/restaurant offer wonderful views of the lagoon.  Pool is nice after a long day in Venice.  The service was top notch, concierge Vittorio was excellent.  Shuttle service was reliable and it was a great way to see Venice as you pull away from the busy docks, glad to be out of the crowds!  This hotel deserves high marks for friendly staff, great food and beverage, all the attention to detail you expect at a 5 star resort.Read moreDate of stay: June 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
