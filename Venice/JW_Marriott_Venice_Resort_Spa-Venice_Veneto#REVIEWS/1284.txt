We are delighted that you and your son had an incredible stay at our Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your positive feedback about our modern and comfortable rooms, incredible food and wonderful staff.  I am also glad that you enjoyed your tour of the Murano Glass Factory. Next time you visit us, you should check out our Squero Tramontin tour to see how gondolas are made. This exclusive excursion via water taxi takes JW guests to the magical and authentic place where gondolas are built and repaired. It is an excursion that I highly recommend to our guests – there is only one place like this in Venice.  Thank you for choosing the JW Venice and we hope to see you and your son again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
