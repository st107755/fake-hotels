All the perks of Venice from a beautifully private and secluded island! Our first time in Venice as a family and we chose JW Marriott due to its location slightly away from the hustle & bustle of 'main' Venice - and what a great idea!

We are delighted that you and your family had an awesome family vacation. We are also grateful for your kind comments about our beautifully secluded island, professional staff, spectacular views and fantastic restaurants.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, as well as a fantastic Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests. I am glad that your kids enjoyed our resort!  Thank you for choosing the JW Venice and we hope to welcome you and your family back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
