I have stayed at a large number of Marriott hotels, most never disappoint, but this one was over the Top Fantastic. Just fully renovated, unreal view of Venice. It all started to be great when you arrive by Water taxi, be sure to grab dinner at the top floor restaurant, outdoors overlooking St. Marks Venice, book for sunset! Great food. The rooms are large, very new look and contemporary! Breakfast was very good, there really isn't a bad thing to say about this resort. Service was 5 star!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 7, 2016Dear dgoose, thanks for your review.
