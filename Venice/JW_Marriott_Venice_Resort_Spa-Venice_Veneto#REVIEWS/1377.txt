I was a little concerned about some reviews and even more concerned about Audi taking over the main building for 3 weeks. But, we have been here for 3 days now and our experience has been outstanding.   They have tons of staff, all smiling and willing to help in any way. The shuttle is a breeze, you just have to time your trips to line up with the shuttle.   The food has been outstanding (but not cheap). The drinks even more expensive. It is for the Lifestyles for the rich and famous:)   As a summary, I would highly recommend the resort if you can afford it. It is so quiet and relaxing. The staff is great, as well is the food and service.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 15, 2015Dear Sir,  How lovely it was to read your review of our JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa!
