If you want to visit Venice, but not live in the middle of the chaos in the city, want to have a private, luxurious island, with great staff servicing your every need, overlooking the city of venice, 4 different styles of accommodation to chose from, dining on the roof, swimming on the roof, big big gardens with relaxing areas, great food, great wine - and still only be 10 mins on a boat from Venice? Well then you should stay at this hotel. Its great. As a couple or even a family. It works very well for both. I can't fault anything at this hotel but I told the management when I left that another restaurant on the island and a bigger swimming pool for families and then this is paradise when you want to visit Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 24, 2016Dear RichardU71, thanks so much for taking the time to provide feedback on your recent stay with us. We are grateful for your generous comments about our great staff, delicious food and wine and convenient location.

Many of our guests tell us that they really enjoy the combination of accessibility to Venice and peace and seclusion that our hotel offers after a full day of sightseeing. Being able to provide this oasis of calm is what makes us special and why many of our guests who are frequent visitors of Venice decide to stay with us time and time again.
