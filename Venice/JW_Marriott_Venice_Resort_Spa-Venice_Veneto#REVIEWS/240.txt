I stayed here with my wife and 5 year old daughter for 4 nights. This is a beautiful hotel, and it does have excellent facilities but it is expensive, so bear that in mind. The breakfast has a great variety of food and Simone in the breakfast hall made a lot of effort, bringing me a different vegetarian breakfast every day. The children's pool was great and the rooftop pool has amazing views of Venice. The kids club was run by a lady called Therese who was very kind to our daughter. Overall, we were very happy with our stay here.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
