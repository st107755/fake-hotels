We booked here on the theory that it would be a quiet, high service demarcation for exploring Venice.   The fact is that the hotel books large groups who have loud dance parties on the common lasting until midnight!  The group needs overload the food service options.   We were advised to order room service because a group had taken over all dining option!  The high priced suites which we booked are far away from the main hotel.  Service out here is slim to none.  No bottle opener, no ice.  No air-conditioning!   Stay at the Cipriani or the Gritti Palace.  For the same amount of money you will have a better experience!Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 25, 2017Dear Colleen G, thank you for taking the time to write a review.
