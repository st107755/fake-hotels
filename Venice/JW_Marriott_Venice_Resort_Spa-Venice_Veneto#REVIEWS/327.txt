The hotel is an oasis of calm and relaxation, you are away from the hustle and bustle from Venice and its so easy accessible with the 30 min shuttle available both ways.. We stayed in a Deluxe room with a gorgeous view overlooking Venice city. The rooftop pool has the most amazing view, it does get quit busy. The Spa was amazing too with a lovely steam room and Jacuzzi. The staff are very helpful and friendly at all times. I would definitely recommend and cant wait to go back!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
