This hotel, the rooms, the grounds, the restaurants, the gym, and the spa are GORGEOUS! Everything is clean and well-maintained. The breakfast buffet is delicious and offers a wide variety that caters to international visitors. It was a really pleasant and relaxing stay. My major caveats were - lack of service/assistance dealing with food allergies and very inconvenient for truly experiencing Venice. It  costs a great deal of time and money to get to-and-from the mainland. If desiring a spa/relaxation vacation on a private island, I'd recommend it, but for experiencing Venice, the location is less than ideal.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 24, 2016Dear kelseanna, thanks so much for writing a review.
