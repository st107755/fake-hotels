Just a gorgeous hotel. Very friendly staff and great restaurant. One of the few hotels in Venice with a pool. Fabulous amenities. The downside: a total pain to get to. They did a nice job with the ferry, but we were always worried that we'd miss the last ferry at night and water taxis were very expensive. We had an early morning flight the last day and opted to stay closer to the airport the last night so we wouldn't have to pay hundreds of dollars to get to the airport in a private taxi because the ferry wasn't running that time of day. Other than that though, just a wonderful retreat.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 28, 2017Dear BrownDog3, thanks for your glowing review.
