My wife, 18 yr old daughter and I stayed at this unique resort for 4 days and we love every minute. Chef Miki Milan who does the cooking courses is amazing and entertaining. We had a blast and perfected Bolognese, pasta and Tiramisu. We all loved it. Our first class had 13 people, couples celebrating honeymoon and families. Great fun! The Spa was outstanding and Dopolavoro Restaurant was as well. We almost forgot to visit Venice Island.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 22, 2016Dear Guest, thanks for your positive feedback.
