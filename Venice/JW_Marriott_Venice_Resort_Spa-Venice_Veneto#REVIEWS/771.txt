We are delighted that you enjoyed your short stay at our resort.  We hope your next visit with us will be a longer one â€“ there is so much to do at our magical Isola delle Rose. When the team and I were organizing the excursions that we wanted to provide our guests, we thought of all the things that would be part of the ultimate travel experience of Italy. From interactive cooking classes with Chef Micki to a tour of a traditional Murano glass-making factory, we wanted to showcase our passion for Italy and highlight some of the wonderful and fascinating aspects of its culture and history. We hope you will be able to check out our exciting activity program during your next stay.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
