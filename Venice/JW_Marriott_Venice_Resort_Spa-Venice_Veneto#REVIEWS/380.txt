I love my Marriotts and JWs always offer high end experiences. So this review is coming from the perspective of what you get for the price. Resort: incredible. Unique experience. Workers: the best part. Most were so kind. But they upcharged for EVERYTHING! Extra guest, breakfast, everything. I was EXTREMELY disappointed in all the upcharges for a platinum member booking 2 large rooms. No platinum lounge. No meal Perks. Nothing. Loved the experience. Loved the island. But it was worth about 1/2 what I paid. Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare
