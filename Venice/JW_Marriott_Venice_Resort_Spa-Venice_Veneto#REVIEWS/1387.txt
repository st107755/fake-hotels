As always, JW is making your stay fabulous. The room is big, the bathroom can be opened and has all the utilities you can think of. The bathroom ammenities are roberto cavalli and the service is discreet and always there when you need. The bar was not so impressive, but you can find something suitable. Food also awesome. The view of the room was in the garden and offers discretion.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 10, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor.
