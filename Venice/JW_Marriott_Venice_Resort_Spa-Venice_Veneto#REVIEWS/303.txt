Enjoyed our stay at the Marriott.  They have a complimentary shuttle that runs every 30 minutes from the hotel to Piazza San Marco (the ride actually takes 30 minutes).  The roof top infinity pool has a great view of Venice and very relaxing once you get back to the hotel grounds from the city of Venice.  Breakfast buffet has a nice selection as well.  Room 229 is a junior site with a large balcony.  Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
