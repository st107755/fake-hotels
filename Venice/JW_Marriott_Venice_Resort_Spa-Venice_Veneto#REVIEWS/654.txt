Had a romantic 4 day break in September 2016. i was not sure what to expect other than it would be a bit pricey. we took a shared water taxi from airport to the square and then got hotel taxi from there a great way to see some of the sights along the way. On arrival we checked in but the room was a bit gloomy so we asked to change and we were given a much brighter room the following day very happy with the service. The food in the restaurant was great and when you accept the high prices are normal and relax into it the views and feel of Venice is unique. I would recommend this hotel but you need to be prepared for the shuttle to and from the island that takes about 20 minutes each way.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 16, 2017Dear Mrgrahamv, thanks for taking the time to write a review.
