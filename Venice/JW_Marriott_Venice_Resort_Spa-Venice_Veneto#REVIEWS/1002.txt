Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
