Had the most amazing long weekend at this hotel. Could not fault a thing, staff are amazing and polite, nothing is too much trouble. A truely stunning hotel. Our room was beautiful and spacious. We had a junior suite on the third floor with a lovely view over the water to Venice. The boat transfer was professional and reliable. Rooftop pool was a real bonus although perhaps a few more sunbeds would be a welcome addition. Thank you so much for a perfect weekend, I hope to return!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 31, 2015Dear Sam,  We would like to thank you for your feedback.
