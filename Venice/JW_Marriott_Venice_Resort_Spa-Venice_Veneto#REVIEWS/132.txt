- The view from our studio suite was a fire escape - The water pressure was equivalent to that of a drizzle of rain - The children facilities are closed off peak which we weren’t informed about - One of the restaurants does not open until May again which we weren’t informed about - Only one of the restaurants has a kids menu and the food is very limited - Shuttle service had to turn people away including young children at night as the boat was too full  - The drinks are expensive and cocktails are poor quality  Overall not the experience you would expect from a ‘newly renovated’ 5 star hotel.   Whilst the island is pretty we spent every moment we could off of the island!

Further to the honest feedback in regards of your room, hotel facilities and shuttle boat service, we would like to apologize for the inconvenience occurred. We regret to read that you did not enjoy our Studio Suites room, as well as you could not find any facility available for the kids. I am glad to confirm that our Kids Club is now opened on a daily basis, and that our children are welcomed in our rooftop pool named Infinity while the Family Pool will open soon in mid-May.  We  apologize for falling short with the drinks quality and pricing. We have shared your opinion with our Food & Beverage Team in order to continue to enhance our guests' experience and satisfaction. May you decide to give us another opportunity, please do not hesitate to contact me directly and I will personally take care of any arrangement or request you may need.
