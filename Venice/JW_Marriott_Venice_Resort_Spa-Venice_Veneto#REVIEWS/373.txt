Take a water taxi from the airport to the JW on it's private island. That is a memorable experience on it's own. The island is minutes away from Venice proper, and the hotel provides boat shuttles on a regular basis. This place is magical.  Service, room, grounds - exceptional. From the pool you can see Venice, close but far enough to be away from the crowds. Would go back in except there are too many other wonderful places yet to be explored!  I rarely return to a hotel more than once, unless it's for business.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
