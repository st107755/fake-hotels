The one thing hardly anyone gets in Venice is space. This used to be a TB hospital years back and has the advantage of a lovely, mature garden which even has olives. They must have spent an absolute fortune converting it. It's very smart indeed.  It also heaves with large US folk waiting for the departure of their cruise ships but no matter. We got upgraded to a maisonette in the grounds. The roof top pool was loved by our kids. We tried a buffet supper which again went down well with the children. I also ate in the posh restaurant and it's impressive. The boar to and from St Marks works well. It ain't cheap - nothing in Venice that is any good is - but after a day tramping around the streets you need a breather and this provides it in spades.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
