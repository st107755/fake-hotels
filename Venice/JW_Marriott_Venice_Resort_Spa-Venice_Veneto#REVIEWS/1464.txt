Being a regular on this site, both to review and read reviews, it really pains me not to leave 5 stars, but on this occasion, it doesn't ! Let me start by saying the hotel is lovely. It is evidently new and has a nice plush feel to it. We arrived on our first night, tired, at around 11pm due to a flight delay.

Thank you also for highlighting very good aspects of your stay such as the beauty of the hotel in general, its unique setting and the comfort of its rooms and suites (especially the last one you were assigned).  We do apologize if we didn't match fully your expectations. At the check-in it is a common practice to require an authorization for a certain sum based on the length of the stay.

Sincerest regards,  Cristiano Cabutti Director of Sales & MarketingRead more
