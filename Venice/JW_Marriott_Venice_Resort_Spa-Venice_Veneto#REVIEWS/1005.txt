We loved this place so returned this year.  Our room was amazing, bowl of fresh fruit and  chilled prosecco waiting for us in our room.  The staff were so helpful, friendly and couldn't do enough for you.  We didn't have dinner at the hotel but breakfast was fabulous, what a selection. Expectations were high as we'd been before.  We like being away from the crowds in Venice.  However, when we arrived off our flight very tired we were disappointed to find that the boat from St Marks to the Island was full and we had to wait another half hour,  By the time the next boat arrived everyone was pushing each other to get on which resulted in people shouting at each other.   Although I love the island, not knowing if your going to get on the boat has put us off returning for a 3rd time.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 2, 2016Dear Fiona0314, thank you for writing a review. We are thrilled that you enjoyed your first experience at our magical Isola delle Rose so much that you decided to return this year. We appreciate your kind comments about our lovely island, amazing rooms and fabulous breakfast.  However, I am very sorry to hear about the inconvenience you experienced with regards to our shuttle service upon your arrival. Since our shuttle service operates on a first come first serve basis, we always recommend that guests arrive at least 20 minutes before the departure time to ensure that they get a seat on the boat.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope that you will consider visiting us again in the future.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
