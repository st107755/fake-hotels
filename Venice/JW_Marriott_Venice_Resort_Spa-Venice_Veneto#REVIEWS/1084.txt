We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your week-long stay with us! We appreciate your kind comments about our nice facilities, friendly staff, excellent breakfast and efficient shuttle service.  I agree, I think one of the main benefits of staying on your own private island is the peaceful retreat our resort provides after a busy day in Venice. Venice is certainly an exciting and thrilling destination, with its vibrant culture and rich history as well as the hustle and bustle of its crowded streets but many of our guests tell us that they like being able to come back to our relaxing hotel after a full day on the main island.
