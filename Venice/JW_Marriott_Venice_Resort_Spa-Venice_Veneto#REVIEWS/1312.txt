We were happy with our choice to revel in the true luxury of JW Marriott Venice Resort. Beautiful view from our room with a balcony, stunning swimming pool, nice fitness room, and quiet tranquility! The JW Marriott Venice resort lobby and entrance are beautifully composed. What surprise! We stayed at this resort for my dad's 60 years birthday event. The resort team made a lovely surprise gift to my dad - impeccable cappuccino drink with cookies for his morning's birthday after he woke up. We celebrated my dad's birthday at this resort because we needed good time to relax and laugh. It was our great memory! Hospitality team is heedful of comfort of the resort guests and their needs. Our overall experience was best ever!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
