Was not going to review until I saw negative reviews. First, during our stay this month, all had free breakfast, which if you were inclined could pass for your entire day's meal, as it was enormous buffet of quality ingredients. Our room was fantastic, the grounds spectacular, boat service to and from reliable as boat service can be, I think our longest wait was around 5-10 minutes. Venice is crowded, with cruise ships, still one of my favorites. To be able to get off the island to your own private island, with roof top bar and infinity pool was worth the price alone. Did not find one thing to complain about, and as a frequent traveler, those below that did complain seem out of place. You will enjoy your stay at this property.
