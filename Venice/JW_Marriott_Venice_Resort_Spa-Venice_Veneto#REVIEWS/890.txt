This was an amazing hotel experience.  The resort is only 20 minutes away from the hustle of Venice by the free hotel shuttle boat.    We loved the fact that we could escape to our chilled Marriott resort or pop into a very busy Venice, providing the best of both worlds. We had a junior suite which was fantastic. Very spacious, comfortable and provided all we needed. Staff were very well trained and very friendly as you would hope. We experienced the two pools which were fantastic.   Rooftop views from the pool are stunning.    Breakfast was excellent.    We ate in the restaurants for lunch and dinner at various times and we were never disappointed.  We experienced the Spa and had a lovely massage and this was a nice way to finish a sight seeing day. We would go back tomorrowâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 19, 2016Dear Graham W, thanks for your review.
