Perfect location in Venice on it's own Island, a peaceful get away from the city yet close enough to visit every day and even twice a day to explore the city. Free shuttle boat very punctual.   Celebrated my husband's 40th Birthday here and they helped make it very special for us.   Beautiful grounds, lovely roof top pool and bar. Very relaxing.
