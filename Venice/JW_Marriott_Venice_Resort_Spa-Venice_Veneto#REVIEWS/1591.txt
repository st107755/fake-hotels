This hotel is on its own island,"Isla del rosa" or island of roses.  It is a 20 minute boat ride to the other islands, like Venice, Murano or Burano.  So it's close enough to everything and yet feels far away.  The resort is the most beautiful we have seen and the staff is warm and welcoming.  On the island, there is a spa, a fitness center, gardens, a play ground and other beautiful lush areas to explore.  The highlight of the property in my opinion, is the disappearing edge pool at the roof top restaurant.  As you are in the pool, you look out across the lagoon with the most beautiful views of St Marks square and surrounding areas.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
