This was our third trip to Venice and on both other occasions the overwhelming emotion was one of tiredness mixed with amazement of the city.

We were there on our anniversary and they upgraded us to an apartment which had its own decking and sunbeds - very nice.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
