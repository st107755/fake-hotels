We are thrilled that you and your family enjoyed your stay at our magical Isola delle Rose. We are grateful for your generous comments about our amazing and stylish hotel as well as our amiable and polite staff.  We hope that your children had the chance to check out our Kids Club. When the team and I were brainstorming the activities for the Kids Club program, we wanted to offer something that would incorporate aspects of Italian culture so that the children would get to know the history and traditions of our beautiful country.
