Enjoyed a very hospitable stay with my mother at this hotel,  Was able to watch the World Cup in the main lobby, had a room with a stunning view and outdoor seating area The breakfast reall is the crowning glory, with omlettes made in front of you, pancakes and waffles, Champagne available, a variety of fresh fruit. Enjoyed the frequent boat trips into town and overall a great stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
