This hotel is a well run resort on its own island near Venice.  The room we had was very nice.  In order to get to San Marco Square in the heart of Venice we had to take a 25 minute shuttle boat trip.  This added time if you wanted to go out to dinner or lunch later than sightseeing around the town.  We did not feel as if we were experiencing Venice. It was more of a resort feeling.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 15, 2016Dear  Joan B, thanks for leaving a review. We appreciate your kind comments about our well-run resort and nice rooms.   We believe having the ability to escape Venice’s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit; our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
