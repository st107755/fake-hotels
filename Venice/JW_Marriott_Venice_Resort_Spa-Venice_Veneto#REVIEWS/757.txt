This is a Hotel on it's own island in Venice. It is about a 15 minute boat ride to Venice but they have shuttles running ever 10 - 15 minutes. What we enjoyed, after being in Venice for 6-7 days was how quiet it was. The food was very good and had a wide variety from all over Italy. We took a water taxi to the train station when we left to go home and it was about 85E, which wasn't too bad. Overall, I would say this is a great place to stay especially with the shuttles to town. Our room was in a separate building and we had our own concierge Elsa who took very good care of us and helped us out.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 27, 2017Dear Buzz J, thanks for our positive feedback. We appreciate your kind words about our quiet atmosphere and good food.  I agree, I think one of the main benefits of staying on your own private island is the serene retreat our resort provides after a busy day in Venice. Venice is certainly an exciting and thrilling destination, with its vibrant culture and rich history as well as the hustle and bustle of its crowded streets but many of our guests tell us that they like being able to come back to our relaxing hotel after a full day on the main island.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
