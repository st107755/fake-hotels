Ok, so we stayed in a suite. Honestly nothing special. all four star's I've rated go to the island itself. If u want to relax, definitely stay here. if not, don't bother. Boring as hell. If you like strolling around the island highly recommended.   Facilities are good, ferry service - commendable. Food, so so. Spa was packed when we went there and we couldn't even use it, but it looked nice.   We are gold elite members, but it doesn't mean anything here. They kept saying we are a resort - so didn't get many perks as advertised by Marriott rewards.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
