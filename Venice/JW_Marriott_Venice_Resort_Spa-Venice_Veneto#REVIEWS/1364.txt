The JW Marriott in Venice is a new hotel set away from the busy waterways of Venice itself.  It sits in substantial private grounds, offering residents the chance to walk or jog in privacy.  The rooms are wonderful, and I slept soundly on the comfortable bed with the air-con at exactly the right temperature.  The restaurant is very good, and my breakfast order of two fried eggs appeared faster than I can remember in any other five star establishment.  The only downside is pretty slow internet considering how new the hotel is. But hey, you come here to rest rather than work!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 22, 2015Dear Ian,  Thank you for your lovely review and for taking the time to share it here on TripAdvisor. We are delighted to read you particularly loved the quality of food served at our restaurants and have been impressed by your breakfast order appeared faster than ever experienced!   Thank you also for highlighted the beauty of our finely designed rooms, comfortable beds and working air-conditioning - as you could noticed from some previous reviews, this summer we unfortunately experienced some issues related to the a/c system but now everything has been definitely fixed and solved.  Regarding your observations related to the WiFi system, we actually recently improved it and there are two different options to be connected - the Basic and the Premium. The second one is faster compared to the Basic and it is 10MB fast.  We thank you again for sharing your comments with us and we truly look forward to welcoming you back to Venice and to our Isola delle Rose!  With best regards,  Linda Bertoni Marketing & Communication ManagerRead more
