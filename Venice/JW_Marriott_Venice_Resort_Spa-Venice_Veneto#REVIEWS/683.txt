Having returned from an enjoyable cruise we decided to spend a few days in Venice but wanted somewhere a bit quieter. We booked Mariott Venice Resort and spa and what a great choice it was. We had a fantastic stylish suite with a plunge pool and patio. Every member of staff greets you and looks after you very well. Unfortunately we cannot remember all the names but thanks to the JW Villas team for their service and to Manuel Sgroi for helping us with our luggage in such a good way. It was great to dip our toes into Venice and  be in St Marco Square by boat transfer yet you can spend time in the peace and quiet of the Hotel looking at the Venice skyline from the bar and infinity pool. There are lovely peaceful gardens to walk around. Overall loved the hotel and we would go backRead moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 5, 2017Dear PaulPauline783, thanks so much for your wonderful review. We are grateful for your generous comments about our stunning hotel, stylish suites, attentive staff and peaceful gardens.  It sounds like you were able to enjoy our lush grounds. Our century-old park is a 16-hectare expanse of greenery â€“ a mixture of old trees and soft lawns, which is impossible to find elsewhere in Venice. I think our historic gardens are one of the most picturesque locations with its scenic 360-degree views of Venice.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
