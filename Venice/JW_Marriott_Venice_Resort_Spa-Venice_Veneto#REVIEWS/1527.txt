Recently returned from a 4 night stay at the JW Marriott in Venice. The Hotel is rated 5* and is certainly in a wonderful position across the water from St Marks Square. It is set in pretty gardens and is extremely peaceful and tranquil after the hustle and bustle of the mainland! The Hotel is extremely stylish and spotlessly clean. Unfortunately the rooms are not particularly practical . There is a distinct lack of storage space both in the bedroom and bathroom and consequently the room is extremely untidy. The coffee maker is a little complicated and tea etc is not replenished efficiently. I also found it very surprising there was no fresh milk. There is no free Wifi In the rooms but it is available in the public areas, again very surprising when one considers this is a 5*â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
