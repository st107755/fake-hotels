This hotel is one of the best Marriott properties I have visited in my 1500+ Marriott stays.  Setting on the private island is spectacular.  It is an oasis of calm a short private JW Marriott boat ride away from Venice. Service is stellar.  My only complaint is that breakfast is not included even for Marriott Platimum Elite members.  Breakfast is 35â‚¬ per person. This hotel would be a phenomenal destination wedding or corporate reward trip location. Consider taking a private water ferry ride from the Venice S. Lucia station to San Marco to meet the JW Marriott boat. Look for the JW Marriott black sign in the Water Taxi area to the right side of the vaporetto San Marco station.  If you decide on  vaporetto ride, take the  on Number 2 Rialto-San Marco line. It is slow and crowded.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
