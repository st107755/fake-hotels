We stayed at the resort for two days.   Private island with transportation from St. Mark's Square by water taxi.   Perfecto! Beautiful accommodations in surroundings  that are peaceful and tranquil.  Food is OK and pricey.  Staff is so accommodating and friendly.   Expensive treat for two days but a wonderful way to end a three week vacation.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 13, 2017Dear p0ny123, thanks for your review. We appreciate your generous comments about our elegant resort, beautiful accommodations, peaceful and tranquil surroundings and friendly staff.  I have noticed that many guests plan a trip to Venice for only a few nights, but the feedback I have received from all of them afterwards is that they wished they stayed longer. Our guests are pleasantly surprised by the many activities that we have as well as our amazing facilities, such as the GOCO Spa. We always encourage our guests to book a longer stay â€“ at least four or five nights so that they can experience all the wonderful things that we offer.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
