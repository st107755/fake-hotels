Probably the best hotel we ever stayed. From the very beginning first class. Rooms are perfect, location on the island with boat service to St. Marks square the best in Venice. But best of all is the rooftop terrace with pool and phantastic view. This is THE place to be in Venice. Also the staff is first class. We got an upgrade to a Junior Suite with large balcony, really one of the most beautiful rooms in any european hotels. Whenever we will come back to Venice we will stay at JW Marriott.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
