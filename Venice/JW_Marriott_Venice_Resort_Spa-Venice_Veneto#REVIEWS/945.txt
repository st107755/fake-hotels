We visited the JW in Venice last year, pre-opening. Some said there were teething problems, I didn't really notice it then. A year on and things have got distinctly better. yes the weather helps, but what was a little too pristine for me, now looks lived in and the corners more rounded. Highlight of our trip (still here BTW!) was the Chef's visit to the fish & veg market and then cooking class to eat what we purchased. Micky Milan is a first rate chef and above all a brilliant guy - well worth your investment. Claudia in Guest Relations has been extremely helpful and very attentive. i really appreciate her help and support. A few days remaining and will be back again next year - if I'm allowed?  irritations and things to bear in mind: 1. Wi-fi logs you out daily - why can't itâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 26, 2016Dear StewartVSNi, thanks for your feedback.
