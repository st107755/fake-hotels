Probably the finest hotel I have been to. Although very new, it feels established with a very modern twist on the traditional Grand Canal Venice. The upgraded suite was fabulous, with a massive comfortable bed and huge balcony/sun deck. Excellent breakfast and the regular JW courtesy water taxi to St. Marks Square is superb. A very pleasant experience, with polite staff. The jars of courtesy sweets in the reception area and free bottles of water everywhere was a nice touch. Recommended. Free wifi if you register for their rewards program beforehand!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
