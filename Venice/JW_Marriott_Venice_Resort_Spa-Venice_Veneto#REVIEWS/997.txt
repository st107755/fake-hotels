The hotel is set on a small island in the Venice lagoon, about 20 minutes away from Piazza San Marcos, connected with a free shuttle provided by the hotel every 30 minutes.   The property is new and very vast. The rooms are brand new and elegantly furnished. We traveled with our young children and stayed at two connecting rooms.  Staff very friendly and helpful.   Great place to stay for young children, as the hotel has a very large children area with a pool, sports activities and more. My kids hit the pool every afternoon, after a hot and tiring day walking through Venice. It was perfect to make our Venice trip amenable.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 5, 2016Dear ab83675, thanks for your wonderful feedback. We are grateful for your generous comments about our elegantly furnished guest rooms, helpful staff and family-friendly resort.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. As you mentioned, our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as an amazing Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
