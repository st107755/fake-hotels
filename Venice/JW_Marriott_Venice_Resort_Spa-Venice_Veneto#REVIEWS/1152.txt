Currently staying here and having travelled to many luxurious resorts this hotel is trying to compete but far from it. I have never seen such a disorganised restaurant! The first time we got no service and the second time just the drinks alone took about 30 mins to be served!  The sofa bed is not comfortable! The only person worth any credit is the one looking after the rooftop swimming facilities....he seems to know what service is....as for the rest there is a lot of training needed!
