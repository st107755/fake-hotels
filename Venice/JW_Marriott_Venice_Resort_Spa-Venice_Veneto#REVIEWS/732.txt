We know how exhausting travelling can be, so we ensure that we take extra special care of our guests who arrive and check-in to our resort late in the evening. Our night staff are specifically trained to provide the smoothest arrival experience because we know how inconvenient and tiring it is, especially guests travelling with children. I am delighted that Barbara made sure that you were happy with your check-in experience and we were able to expedite your room service order.
