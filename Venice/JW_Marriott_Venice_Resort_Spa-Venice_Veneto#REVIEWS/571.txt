This is our first trip to Europe and Venice.  The Marriott was amazing- the property was extremely well maintained.  The benefit of this hotel is that you can get out of Venice and the crowds. It was great to take a day and lounge at the pool, enjoy the spa and relax.  Danielle, Lenche were great masseurs.  Also enjoyed the cooking class, Gabriele helped me schedule and was the highlight of every day!  Piero our chef was patient and hoped creat pizza and focaccia!  Well worth it:)   Such a great trip will come back again Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 25, 2017Dear Kim G, thanks for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our amazing resort, well-maintained property and wonderful staff.  What we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to San Marco Square means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
