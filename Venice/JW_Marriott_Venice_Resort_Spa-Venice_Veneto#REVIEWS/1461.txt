This hotel was 3 months old when we visited. It is perfectly situated on a private island and has its own water taxi. This definitely helps to get away from the hustle and bustle of Venice and you have free transportation that is very frequent. The hotel also has a private pier for incoming taxis. The rooms were very spacious and very nice.  The hotel staff was also really accommodating too.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 8, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for your feedback on your recent stay!
