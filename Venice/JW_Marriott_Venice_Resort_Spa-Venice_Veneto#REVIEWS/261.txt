Our 3rd visit and never disappoints. Very relaxed and well appointed hotel and never feels overcrowded. Not cheap but you get what you pay for, good base to visit Venice being based on its own island with regular free on the hour and half hour boat shuttle to San Marco. Hotel itself provides good service and food and special mention to DANILO in the Sagra restaurant who was very attentive and knowledgeable with A1 service. Can’t recommend it enough but I shouldn’t really because don’t want the world to visit and spoil this paradise in Venice but credit where credit is due.
