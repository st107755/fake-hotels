This is a beautiful hotel with lots of space. It's mostly pristine (although the main building could do with a paint outside, lots of water marks) and very well maintained internally. The rooms are extremely comfortable and have lots of light. Bed are gorgeously fluffy and I loved the Aromatherapy Associates  toiletries. The corridors smell absolutely amazing too! It's lovely to walk around the olive trees in the grounds and we were delighted that our son could enjoy a swim in the rooftop adult pool with the amazing views back to Venice while we took in the view with a coffee in hand - perhaps this was only because the kids pool wasn't yet open for the season though.  We carefully chose this hotel because we thought that a luxury speed boat trip would be the highlight of our dayâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
