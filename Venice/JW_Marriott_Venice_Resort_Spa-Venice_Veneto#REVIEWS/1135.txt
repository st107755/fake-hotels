Amazing stay! Staff is friendly and always willing to help and make your stay pleasant. The only down side sometimes is the boat shuttle that takes 20mins from hotel to San Marco. But besides that it was an amazing stay. We did the cooking class with Mickie as he was extremely friendly and fun during our pizza cooking class. We also did a couples spa that was very relaxing  JW did an amazing job here, and even when the staff is overwhelmed they do a great job with all of the people they interact here! Can't say enough for making our honeymoon a very special stay!

We are delighted that you enjoyed celebrating your honeymoon at our beautiful Isola delle Rose. We are also glad to hear that you enjoyed participating in one of Chef Mickiâ€™s culinary courses. Many of our guests tell us how much they recommend this fun class.  We hope that you were able to check out some of the other activities that we offer at our resort. When the team and I were organizing the excursions that we wanted to provide our guests, we thought of all the things that would be part of the ultimate travel experience of Italy. From interactive cooking classes to a tour of a traditional Murano glass-making factory, we wanted to showcase our passion for Italy and highlight some of the wonderful and fascinating aspects of its culture and history.   Thank you for choosing to stay with us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
