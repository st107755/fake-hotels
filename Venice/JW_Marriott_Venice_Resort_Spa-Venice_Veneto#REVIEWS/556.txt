My husband and I stayed at the JW Marriott resort for our honeymoon in June. The atmosphere and surrounding environment of the hotel alone make it work the stay. The grounds are beautiful, and the rooms are wonderful. The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming, and the food at the hotel restaurants is very good.   The hotel is in a great location and offers up such an amazing experience for visitors.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 2, 2017Dear snet50, thanks for your review.
