This is a really modern and convenient location with extremely good service as you would expect. It is easy to get to and serviced by a shuttle running from St Marks Square every 30 minutes from early to late - no reason not to fully enjoy Venice.  The hotel is on a large island which has a lot of resort facilities during summer, but which shut down overnight. The breakfast is excellent, the rooms modern and there is also a good restaurant for the evening if you do not want to explore Venice.  Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 13, 2017Dear SAPStar, thanks for your review.
