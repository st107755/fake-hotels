Very well managed hotel. Good, modern and tasteful rooms.  Great service. And a spectacular spa - well worth it. Fiola Restaurant is very good. But I didn’t appreciate €35 a head for breakfast; just had a bowl of fruit and coffee....  The location has its pros and cons. Positives it is away from the crowds of Venice, which would be great on a warm day for relaxation.  Also because of this the rooms sizes are generous. The negative is that it requires a bit of planning as it is 20 minutes to St Marks Square and the shuttles go every 30 minutes. Travelling to the outer islands makes for a long day. And the water taxis from the airport are expensive.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
