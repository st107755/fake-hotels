Nice location with free shuttle to the main island every 30 mins. Spacious rooms with nice views. Bikes to move around the island. It has its own church. Roof top restaurant had a beautiful view of the lagoon. Lots of greenery and fragrated flowers on the island. A pleasant experience.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 24, 2017Dear ShilpaPS, thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on your recent experience with us.
