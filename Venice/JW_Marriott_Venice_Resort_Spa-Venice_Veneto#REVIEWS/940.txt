We really enjoyed our time. Everything is new and lovely. I'd especially recommend this property if traveling with children. The outdoor pool provides a nice break after a long day of seeing the sights and dealing with other tourists in the crowd. By far though, the best part of the stay and maybe of all of Venice was our family cooking class with Micki Milan. We have 3 children, 7, 10 and 12. He made it memorable and fun for them. They loved the food and learned how to make delicious/nutritious pasta and sauces from scratch. We parents also enjoyed it. He took his time, was attentive and an overall joy.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 29, 2016Dear Jim B, thanks for your review. We are delighted that you and your family enjoyed your stay at our magical Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your generous comments about our new and lovely facilities.  I am also thrilled that your children enjoyed their cooking class with Chef Micki. I agree; it is such a fun and memorable activity to do with kids! I will make sure to share all the kind comments that you said about him in your review. He will be so glad to hear that they loved learning how to make delicious pasta and sauces from scratch.  We also hope that your children had the chance to check out our Kids Club. When the team and I were brainstorming the activities for the Kids Club program, we wanted to offer something that would incorporate aspects of Italian culture so that the children would get to know the history and traditions of our beautiful country. Some of the activities that we are proud to offer families include Italian language lessons, creating and painting your own mini gondola and making Venetian masks.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
