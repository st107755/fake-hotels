My family and I stayed this hotel on our first trip to Venice back in March 2018 and were amazed at this property from our arrival at the dock via taxi (arrived after shuttle hours... well after!) to the luxuriousness of the room and frankly the resort in general.  Absolutely amazing sanctuary away from the hustle and crowds of San Marco and the shuttle services both to town and train were excellent.  We only had one late night dinner via room service that was nothing short of amazing and breakfast downstairs but everything was excellent.  I can't wait to go back....  be sure to have the camera handy as you arrive at the hotel via water taxi the first time... most unique and amazing entrance to a hotel that I have experienced.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare
