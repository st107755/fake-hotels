The staff was wonderful from check in to check out.  The room was wonderful as well.  The food in the restaurant on the 4th floor was okay but, in my opinion, could have been much better for this type of property.  There is a very nice bar/lounge area in the lobby.  Marriott owns the island that this property sits on, and the grounds are very nice.  The hotel provides a complimentary water taxi to and from St. Mark's throughout the day.  I felt this hotel was a better choice over staying in the tourist area of Venice, which is very crowded and noisy.  Please note that, if you are a member of Marriott's "club" (which is free), you get free wi-fi in your room.  Otherwise, there is a $7-8 charge per day.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 14, 2015Dear Sir,  We would like to thank you for your detailed feedback.
