Beautiful resort located outside Venice. The island is just 20 min away from Venice by boat but is very peaceful. Rooftop pool was gorgeous and looked across the way to Venice...incredible sunsets. Upon arrival, staff greeted you like royalty and treated you well. The free shuttle to/from Venice was very convenient and always on time. I definitely will go back!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 19, 2016Dear karensheltonmur, thanks for your wonderful feedback.
