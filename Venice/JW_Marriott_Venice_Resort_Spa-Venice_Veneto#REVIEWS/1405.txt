Stayed at the JW Marriott Venice in August this year and we were extremely happy with our stay. Arrival and departure by private water taxi is a must and adds to the real experience. The breakfast is sufficient with everything you want and need. We stayed in a garden room away from the main house which was a true joy and enjoyed walking around the island. The island itself is perfectly located as a true escape from hectic Venice and acts as a refuge to digest all the impressions from the city and Biennale. The only criticism I have would be the light shining on to the porch of the room as it is a magnet for mosquitoes which can be really unpleasant when opening the door to access/exit. Staff: Top! Pool: Top!  We will definitely be coming back and recommending it!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 8, 2015Dear Sir,  How lovely it was to read your review of our JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa!
