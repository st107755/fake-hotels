We recently stayed at the JW Marriott in Venice for 3 nights. We had a 2 story room with a private pool. It was a very nice resort however the resort could use some work. When you compare it to other European resorts it is very nice but compared to other JW Marriott resorts in the US, it needs work. The service was very good. The kids loved the family pool and arriving by boat. I would recommend the resort to families and couples.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare
