The Marriott Venice Resort & Spa is an excellent resort, quiet, helpful staff, 24 hour gym, good shuttle service (free) to San Marco. The resort is located on an island, which is outstanding. Buffet was great. Service a little slow elsewhere, but staff are helpful and the place has a slight feel of work in progress. I would caution parents with little children not to let them run around - as an island many places a child could end up in the water. Overall a great experience.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 8, 2015Dear Sir,   We would like to thank you for your feedback.
