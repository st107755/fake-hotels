JW Marriott Venice was one of the best hotel stays during our honeymoon! The welcomed us with a personal note and bottle of NICE champagne.The grounds are beautiful and food is impeccably fresh and tasty. we encountered some of the most creative bartenders / mixologists. The photo below is a twist on a whiskey sour. It was DELICIOUS!  We took advantage of the complimentary water taxi and although crowded at times they ensure that guests don't have to wait. When the taxi was too full instead of having guests wait, the called a personal water taxi at no charge to take the remaining guests back. Talk about first-class service.   We stayed in the villas which was well worth the splurge. Personal patio / deck was a nice amenity.   In summation, we can't wait to return.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 25, 2017Dear michelletippens, thank you so much for your review.
