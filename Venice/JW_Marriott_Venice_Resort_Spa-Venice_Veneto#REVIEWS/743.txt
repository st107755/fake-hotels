Tucked away from the bustle of the main island, we enjoyed our daily escape to Isola delle Rose. The island is very beautiful, quiet, and serene—a perfect getaway! The rooms were very nice, clean, and well-appointed (ours had a mini fridge, hot water pot, and Illy coffee machine for us to use). My only suggestion for the hotel would be for them to put some sort of bench/stool/shelf in the shower… being 7 months pregnant and having to stoop to the floor multiple times to grab soap, shampoo, etc. was challenging and trying to shave my legs was an absolute circus ha ha.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 12, 2017Dear SummerGirl8888, thank you for your glowing review. We are grateful for your kind comments about our beautiful and quiet island and nice and well-appointed rooms.  I agree, I think one of the main benefits of staying on your own private island is the serene retreat our resort provides after a busy day in Venice. Venice is certainly an exciting and thrilling destination, with its vibrant culture and rich history as well as the hustle and bustle of its crowded streets but many of our guests tell us that they like being able to come back to our relaxing hotel after a full day on the main island.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
