I understand some of the 5 star reviews.  It is a very nice property, with modern rooms and facilities and very nice staff with excellent English speaking abilities.  This oasis off the shore of Venice does get you away from the crowds but there is a cost in convenience and price.    It is a long journey to get here from other parts of the country, and very expense if you take water taxis or other premium services suggested by the hotel. We arrived by train and then took the public transport boat along the Grand Canal to San Marco. Then turn right off the boat and find the private wooden pier with the JW Marriott (and 2 other hotel) signs. It takes about 50 min by public boat, then wait for the free shuttle (every 30 min) then 20 min to the island.  Lengthy, but quite easy. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
