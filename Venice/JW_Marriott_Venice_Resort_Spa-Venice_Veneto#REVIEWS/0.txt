This is a  very beautiful property. We initially had some concern about the island location, but as others have mentioned, that turned out to be one of our favorite aspects of this hotel.   Venice can be crushingly crowded and busy, and while we enjoyed all the sightseeing and activities, after a few hours of that each day our family was "done" and looking forward to relaxing in the sun with an adult beverage by the infinity-edge pool with a view of the city. The service was excellent overall, and the food was very good, if pricey.   We had most of our meals in Venice proper, at various restaurants recommended by the very helpful hotel concierge.  The short boat ride to/from the city was a great way to relax and prepare for whatever's next. We also enjoyed a cooking class and meal at the on-site gourmet academy - a really fun way to spend an evening. (*burp* ;-) We would definitely stay here again if we're every fortunate enough to make it back to bella Venezia!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2019RoomsCleanlinessService1 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
