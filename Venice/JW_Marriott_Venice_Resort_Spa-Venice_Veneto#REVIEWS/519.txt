We appreciate your kind words about our exceptional service and fantastic grounds.  As you mentioned, we have expanded our Family Pool to include an interactive water fountain where kids can play and use their imagination to create their own inventions with super-sized waterproof foam bricks. The fountain is suited for children of all ages and is a fantastic addition to our kids-friendly area, which features a playground and Adventure Park as well.
