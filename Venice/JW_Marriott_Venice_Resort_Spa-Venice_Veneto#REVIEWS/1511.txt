If you are coming in from VCE, I recommend taking the private water taxi - its a fair price for a great ride that is better than any of the gondolas you will get in Venice, its also pretty cool arriving in the private entrance. If you are coming in from Venice train station just take the free shuttle from san marco. The resort is just amazing, you can spend a week just relaxing in the hotel pool, spa or room. Shuttles every 15 min to venice and they ran till about 1 am. This was hotel allowed us to get the best of both worlds, relaxation and the hustle/bustle of venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 26, 2015Dear Amar,  We would like to thank you for your feedback.
