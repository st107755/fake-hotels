This place is special. Close enough to Venice that we could see the Campanile from our hotel room. Far enough from the crowds that you could be anywhere in Italy.   The architecture and amenities are brand new, but they've kept the charm of the islands history.   Our 10 course dinner at Dopolovoro was memorable, but my favorite was the breakfast buffet, which is the best I've had at any hotel in the world.   Special thanks to Sara, Andrea, and Elsa from the JW Villas team!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 18, 2017Dear Ray M, thanks for your generous feedback. We are delighted to hear that you had a once-in-a-lifetime holiday at our magical Isola delle Rose!   I am also happy to hear that you had a memorable meal at Dopolavoro. Our resort is a culinary destination in Venice – only six months after its opening Dopolavoro obtained its first Michelin star under the leadership of one of Italy’s most celebrated chefs, Giancarlo Perbellini and his team. What is offered is a traditional but unique gastronomic dining experience. The restaurant is surrounded by our organic botanical gardens, which not only provide guests with a beautiful setting, but also a wide variety of produce that we use in our dishes. It is a luxury dining experience that is not to be missed.   Thank you for choosing to stay with us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
