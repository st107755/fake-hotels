I agree with the other reviews that the staff and level of service really sets this resort apart. Venice is fascinating, historic and unto itself experience. It is also one of the worlds biggest tourist traps. We joked that is a giant Times Square. To be able in 20 minutes to be at a resort that gives you very little reason to want to leave is kind of ideal.   Great kids pool, great roof top adult pool. Variety of dining from fine to medium to casual. Again the staff sets it apart. Friendly, attentive and knowledgeable, kudos to the management team, well run.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 9, 2017Dear Rob L, thanks for your review.
