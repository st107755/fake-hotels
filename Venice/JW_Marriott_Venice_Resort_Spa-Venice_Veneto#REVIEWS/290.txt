We stayed in Venice for one night prior to a cruise. The JW Marriott is unbelievable. The staff is superb. they could not do more for you and always had a smile.  I needed an electric converter which was brought to my room quickly, no charge and given to me to keep. Breakfast was wonderful. The hotel is on an island so it is very quite and serene. High level hotel for sure but the staff was what made it great.Read moreDate of stay: June 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
