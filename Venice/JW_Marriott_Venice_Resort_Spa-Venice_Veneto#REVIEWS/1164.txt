Stayed here for 4 nights and the resort is great! It's ideal for those who want to relax whilst also having the opportunity to visit Venice via the free shuttle boat. Sagra rooftop restaurant had fantastic food and watching the sunset over Venice whilst eating was an added bonus! The staff are all very attentive. A particular shout out to Alessandro who made some great cocktails and recommended some great new rum!

We appreciate your kind comments about our amazing hotel, fantastic food and attentive staff.  I am glad that you had the chance to sample the delicious cuisine at our Sagra Rooftop restaurant. Besides the regular menu, we also offer a special menu from the Cicchetti Bar. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden. One of my favorite dining experiences is enjoying these Venetian-style tapas while overlooking the dramatic skyline of the Lagoon during sunset at our rooftop.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
