The JW Marriott Venice exceeds all expectations from the moment you set foot on the private island.  Beautiful grounds, extremely spacious and nature all around making it perfect for nature lovers.  The rooftop is wonderful with views directly on Venice which is 15 mins with their regular shuttle.  A romantic spot perfect for engagement proposals (as was my case) or weddings.   Will definitely stay there again.  And a big thanks to Andrea Veities who made our stay extremely comfortable and memorable. Wonderful stay so thank you again!
