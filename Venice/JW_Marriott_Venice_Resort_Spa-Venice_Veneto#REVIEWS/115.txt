Great stay at the JW Marriott. Excellent location at Isola delle Rosa, 20 minutes boat ride from Piazza San Marco. The hotel is brand new, has a beautiful rooftop pool with a great view of Venice’s skyline. SPA is also fantastic. Finally, service at the hotel was excellent: friendly, helpful and very professional. Can’t wait to go back!Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
