We kicked off our honeymoon with a night in stay in Venice at a relatively new property the JW Marriott. As a long time Marriott member, this hotel certainly did not disappoint, the staff catered to our every need and was certainly very accommodating even though we arrived a bit early and did not have a room ready for check in.

We are delighted to hear that you had a great start to your honeymoon at our beautiful Isola delle Rose. We really appreciate your generous comments about our state-of-the-art facilities and gorgeous views.  As you mentioned, next time you visit us I would recommend staying longer than a day – there is so much to do on our private island including spending time at our award-winning GOCO Spa – the largest one in Venice. The views that we have from our treatment rooms and our pools are just incredible! Our spa is such a hit with our guests that we now offer a day pass, which includes the use of our sauna, bio-sauna, hammam and yoga gardens, along with our indoor and outdoor pools. We definitely recommend checking it out the next time you stay at our resort.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
