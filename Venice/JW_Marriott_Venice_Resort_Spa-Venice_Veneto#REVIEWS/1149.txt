Situated on a private island off of Venice, this hotel and resort are exceptionally clean with attentive staff. Ideal for a couple's break, we stayed during the last week of the hotel's season before closing for the winter.

Well appointed rooms and lovely grounds with a spa centre and restaurant complemented the hotel.
