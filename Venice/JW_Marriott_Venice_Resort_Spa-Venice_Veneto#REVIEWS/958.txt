Beautiful location in the lagoon. Great to arrive at by water taxi from the airport. Very nice rooms and decor with large grounds and a great pool and space for kids. The only downside is the food was not great - it was overpriced even for Venice and very bland - which is a shame as otherwise a great place to stay. The service was also patchy for a 5* hotel although the concierge was very good.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 22, 2016Dear Simon524, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We really appreciate your generous comments about our beautiful location, nice rooms, large grounds and great pool.  What we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to Venice means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope you visit us again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
