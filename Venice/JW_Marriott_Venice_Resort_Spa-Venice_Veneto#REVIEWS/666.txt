This 5 star property lives up to its name and reputation as a perfect oasis get away in Venice. Easily reachable, the resort is a parkland setting and a wonderful escape from the busy Cory. The staff are exceptional and courteous.  The environs, pool, bar are relaxing and the food is excellent.  The cover charge for the Sagra Grill Rooftop is unnecessary and when we asked that it be removed they accommodated.  They should remove it entirely but they may have their reasons in a busy season.  Concierge assistance was excellent, helpful and readily available.  This is an expensive region of Venice so it is no exception that rates here are competitive. But they make it worthwhile.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 12, 2017Dear RoyalWestmoreland, thank you for your wonderful review. We appreciate your kind comments about our perfect oasis, exceptional and courteous staff and excellent food.  There is so much to do at our magical Isola delle Rose. When the team and I were organizing the excursions that we wanted to provide our guests, we thought of all the things that would be part of the ultimate travel experience of Italy. From interactive cooking classes at our Sapori Cooking Academy to a tour of a traditional Murano glass-making factory, we wanted to showcase our passion for Italy and highlight some of the wonderful and fascinating aspects of its culture and history.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
