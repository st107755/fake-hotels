Having booked the JW Marriott, we actually went just after it opened in April 2015. The entire island was taken over and remodelled to be a luxury escape from the madness of Venice and it meets that criterion perfectly. The private water taxi from St Mark's Square is a great way to travel to the hotel, the grounds contain some excellent modernist sculptures and the hotel itself is light, airy and well laid out. The staff could not have been any more helpful and polite and are a credit to the company. The food was elegant and delicious (in all of the restaurants) and finally the rooftop pool looking across the lagoon to St Mark's is a wonderful addition. Highly recommended.
