Arriving by private river taxi into the centre of the hotel is like entering the set of a James Bond movie! In magnificent entrance hall, GianMarco checked us in with charm and a warm welcome. The suite was ideally positioned on the 4th floor with stunning views over the immaculately grounds. The Restaurant well deserved its star! The facilities were outstanding, as was the attention of all the staff. An outstanding hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 4, 2016Dear grosvenor2016, thank you for your review. We are delighted that you were impressed by our James Bond-style arrival experience, stunning views, immaculate grounds, outstanding hotel and attentive staff.  I am also happy to hear that you enjoyed dining at our Michelin-starred restaurant, Dopolavoro. Our Executive Chef, Federico Belluco is an impressive person. He is a perfectionist and works everyday for at least 14 hours in the kitchen. Even on his day off he loves to experiment and develop our culinary offering. When the resort closes for the winter, Federico travels the world to find inspiration for his craft. We are very proud of all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes at Dopolavoro so we are grateful for your kind words about your dining experience with us.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
