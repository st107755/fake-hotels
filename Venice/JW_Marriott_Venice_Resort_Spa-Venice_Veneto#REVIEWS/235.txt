This hotel is beautiful, the surrounding grounds are pristinely kept and the service offered by all staff is impeccable - we were even greeted by staff who new our names!   We stayed in a De Luxe room type with a terrace and found it to be perfectly decorated and in an immaculate condition.   We visited the GOCO Spa which offered a total relaxation experience and although it was an additional charge, it was worth it. The main rooftop pool overlooks the centre of Venice and the Sunsets at night are amazing - a view hard to beat!   We ate at the Michelin-starred restaurant, Dopolavora Dining Room and it was an experience not to be forgotten, the food is totally unique and all home grown on Isola delle Rose.   Highly recommend and cannot wait to return!Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
