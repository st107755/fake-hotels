Excellent place. The room they gave us was great but the air conditioner was not working and they put us in a better room.  The service was great and the breakfast buffet was just peachy!  We loved it here and will definitely stay here next time.    The hotel is on an island by itself and they have free boat shuttle.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 8, 2016Dear dsramesh, thanks for your positive feedback. We appreciate your generous comments about our excellent resort, great customer service and good breakfast buffet.  Were you able to go on our Burano Lace tour during your stay with us? It is an incredible experience â€“ you get the chance to meet an experienced lace maker, who has been creating her own beautiful designs for more than 65 years at her workshop on the charming island of Burano. We hope that you had the opportunity to do this amazing excursion.  Thank you for choosing to stay at our Isola delle Rose and we look forward to seeing you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
