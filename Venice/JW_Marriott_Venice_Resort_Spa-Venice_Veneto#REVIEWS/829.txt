We stayed at the JW Marriott on our family vacation to Italy. Venice was our last stop on our two week trip. The hotel was a perfect ending to our travels. The grounds are gorgeous! However our favorite part was the rooftop pool. We could not have asked for a better view. In addition, we met Antonio who was beyond accommodating and friendly. My brother, sister in law, and myself spent an entire day up there relaxing and having some afternoon cocktails. Antonio was great; he remember us from the night prior when we had only spent about an hour at the pool. He also offered suggestions to a few of his favorite restaurants around the city. Great place, great staff!
