Excellent hotel.   You are on a separate island 20 minutes away from St. Mark's square  by shuttle.    It was nice to not have to deal with all the crowds and could have quiet time.     Food was excellent.   Nice buffet in the am.   Nice but small pool area on the roof.    Staff was incredible.  Very modern hotel compared with others in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 5, 2016Dear Miss_PaulaBoston, thanks so much for writing a review. We really appreciate your kind words about our excellent hotel, delicious food and incredible staff.  We are also grateful for your comments on our modern hotel. We are so proud of the beautiful design of our 19 buildings on our private island, which are the work of the renowned Italian architect Matteo Thun. His main focus was to integrate the contemporary elements of the existing buildings to showcase their unique history and personality, while at the same time enhancing the architectural heritage of our location.  Thank you for choosing to stay at the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
