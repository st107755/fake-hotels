My husband and I spent the end of our European trip at this resort early September. After sharing St. Mark's Square with millions of people, we got to enjoy tranquil time to relax. Options were reading at your private patio, walking through the olive grove, or enjoying a drink / meal at the roof top bar and restaurant by the infinity pool! We had some wonderful drinks and meals there. People working for this resort are welcoming, friendly, professional, and passionate with good service. The pool for families is great but away from the main building so kids can have plenty good time without disturbing other. Strongly recommended!Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
