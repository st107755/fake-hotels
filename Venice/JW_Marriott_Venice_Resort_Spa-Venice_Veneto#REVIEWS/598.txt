After wading threw the large crowds in the main city, you'll thank yourself for staying here, a secluded island with huge, beautiful grounds. Service was outstanding, with every staff member incredibly friendly.  We stayed in an out building suite which fit our family of 4 just fine.   Just an fyi if travelling with kids - ours asked us to keep the main city tours to a miniumum so they could spend more time at the hotel swimming and biking around the island.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 17, 2017Dear Christopher D, thanks for your review. We appreicate your kind feedback about our secluded island, beautiful grounds, outstanding service and friendly staff.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our property provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very kids-friendly, with a family pool, interactive water fountain, playground as well as a fun Adventure Park.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
