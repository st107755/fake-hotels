This island resort is beautiful and the staff very gracious,  Getting to and from the airport via a private taxi is $165 each way unless you're able to share your return trip with another couple (which the hotel arranged for us) which cuts the cost in half.  Though expensive, it is worth it.    We only ate at the hotel twice during our two day stay.  Both times it was very expensive.  My turkey roll lunch was $30, and my wife's ham sandwich $25, and that did not include the $9 per person service charge.  The only breakfast alternative was a $41 per person buffet, which we both enjoyed, but again the price seemed excessive.  Commuting to and from the hotel to San Marco was easy.  And the Health Club was well equipped.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
