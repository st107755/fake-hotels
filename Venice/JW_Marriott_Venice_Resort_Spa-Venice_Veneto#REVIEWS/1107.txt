This hotel is a 20 minute boat ride from St. Mark's Square. We were a little worried about this distance, but it became one of the best features of our stay. We loved the boat ride back and forth, complementary shuttle from the Marriott. The hotel itself is beautiful, only a year old, spacious rooms with marble baths. The grounds are landscaped beautifully, roof top pool with views in the distance to Venice.The breakfast buffet is really good.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 16, 2016Dear Fox7122014, thanks so much for writing a review.

All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager  Read more
