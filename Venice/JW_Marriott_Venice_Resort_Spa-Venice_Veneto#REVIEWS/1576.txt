Amazing Panoramic Views of Venice from RoofTop disappearing edge HydoTherapy Pool was the high point of our fortieth anniversary trip to the brand new JW Venice. Truly a 5 star with all the whistles and bells. Our Suite at L'Residenzia #504 was over the top with its own Hydortherapy pool. VERY COMFY BEDS. Staff was all friendly especially Marc, Lucca. Alesandro and Kristina. The 15 minute free boat ride to Rose Island was a refreshing break from the hustle and bustle and Crowds of St. Marks. We have stayed at almost all the 5 star properties in Venice over the last 25years and this is our new Favorite.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
