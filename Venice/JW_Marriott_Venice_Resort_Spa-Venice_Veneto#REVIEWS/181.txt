Great hotel on private island. Very lifestyles of the rich and famous. Arriving by private water taxi is very glamorous as you enter JW Marriott. Beautiful grounds. Great view of Venice. My room was in a private building. Expensive but worth every penny. Nice to get away for crowded VeniceRead moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
