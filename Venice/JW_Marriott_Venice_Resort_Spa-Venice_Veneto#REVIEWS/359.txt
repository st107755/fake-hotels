I am a happy platinum elite member.  Truly a 5 star hotel in every way, private island overlooking Venice, best way to visit the most beautiful city in the world.  Easy access to city by frequent water shuttle.  All of the staff were friendly, gracious, and responsive to all of my needs.  Heart felt thanks to Massimo for greeting me as family, Ilaria in reservations, reception staff, Alessandra at concierge, Angels housekeeping supervisor and dining room staff all. A special thanks to Gabriele, Anna, and Ieva for making my challenging travel arrangement with warmth and smiles - my angels.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
