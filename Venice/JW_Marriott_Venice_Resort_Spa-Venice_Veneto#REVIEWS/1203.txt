We are grateful for your kind comments about our amazing hotel, modern and bright rooms and delicious food.  We hope the next time you visit us it will be for a longer stay. As you mentioned our GOCO Spa is absolutely amazing and you can spend a whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we look forward to welcoming you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
