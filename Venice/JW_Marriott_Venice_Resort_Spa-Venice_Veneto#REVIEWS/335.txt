A great resort in Venice ! So nice to be in the crowds of Venice and then go back to a beautiful resort . Shuttle is so convenient running every 30 minutes  Recommend private taxi when you arrive in Venice by train , may be a bit pricey but well worth it! Beautiful beginning to trip Hotel is delightful - beautiful view by poolside . We will return soon -  I had heard it is pricey but we did not feel that it was ... after all it is Venice ! We had  beautiful breakfast everyday  Enjoy a taxi to Murano or Burano -  We enjoyed a  trip to Murano & recommend a serious stop at CAM !   Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
