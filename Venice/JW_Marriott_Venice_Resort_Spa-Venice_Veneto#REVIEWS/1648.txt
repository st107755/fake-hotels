I've visited this beautiful resort 2 weeks after openings and it was everything set up, like is open for several month. Everything was excellent, especially the stuff. I was there with my 2 daughters and nothing was trouble for this great stuff. Many thanks to all of them, they were doing very good job. Definitely come back soon.
