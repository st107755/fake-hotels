We are delighted that you and your wife enjoyed your stay with us. We appreciate your kind words about our great hospitality, relaxing environment and well-kept facilities.  I am also glad that you enjoyed being pampered at our GOCO Spa. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
