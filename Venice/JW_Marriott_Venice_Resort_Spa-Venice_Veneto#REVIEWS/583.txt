Great hotel with fantastic service!  The staff and the grounds really lend themselves to a five star experience.  Perfect place to escape the self-stick crowds of Venice.  The shuttle works well although be careful as not everyone believes in waiting in line when the shuttle arrives.    The rooms and very new and the room top pool is nice.    As others have said the food on the island is very expensive in some cases it is worth it as we found with Dopolavoro, and in other cases such as the restaurant on the roof we found it to be extremely expensive (140 Euro lunch for 2).   We were very happy with our stay and would stay here again if we return to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 20, 2017Dear conshy2004, thanks for your positive feedback. We appreciate your generous comments about our great hotel, fantastic service, beautiful grounds and nice rooftop pool.  We hope you had the chance to explore our private island by bicycle. One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with loved ones, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for choosing to stay with us and we hope to welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
