An standing resort. The quality of the room and all the installation is great. The courtesy of the staff and the quality of the service throughout the resort is outstanding. Of course it's on an island. Very close to Venice and yet a good 20 minute ride on their shuttle. You have to t at least an hour for a quick tour of San Marco before going to bed. The only real downer is our diner at Sagra rooftop restaurant. When I pay more, I expect more and didn't it. It was very below average. I had much better food in restaurant half their price. At the end, ok for breakfast and for a snack by the, but consider dining in town. They have another restaurant that would earn one Michelin star. After my experience, I didn't want to take any chance.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear Laniero, thanks so much for your review.
