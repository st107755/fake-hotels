Hi ! We are currently staying at the JW Marriott, Venice room 009. And we currently are facing a lot of teething problems the rooms had cob webs to begin with along with a lot of mosquitoes to accompany making it almost impossible for us to sleep well.  The door lock is an everyday issue the lock is spoilt and we need to replace the key every single time which doesn't promise to work fine after 1 use.  V disappointed with our stay here.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 9, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for your comment posting while you were here in Venice; during your stay, our Reception Team was assisting you to solve the electronic lock inconvenience of your door.  Our Security Team directly met you, assuring that while you were out of your room visiting Venice, we would have fixed the issue. This has been effectively done and, once back to Venice, you simply collected the new key-cards and the door was correctly working. We apologize if you, somehow, felt we lack of attention with you, but we actually immediately took action and promptly solved the issue.  Regarding insects, this year in particular Venice is being affected by the presence of many mosquitoes. We offer our guests a dedicated plug-in insect repellent which is located inside the drawer of each guestroom and we also recommend - through a window-hanger - keeping the windows closed in order to avoid any insects entering in the rooms.  We are sorry to read your disappointment and please be assured we did our best to make your stay a memorable one.  Please accept our sincere apologies for not meeting your expectations and hopefully one day you will return to our unique and amazing property to allow us to regain your confidence.  Sincerest regards,  Linda Bertoni Marketing & Communication ManagerRead more
