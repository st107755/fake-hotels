JW Marriot has beyond a doubt created the best place to stay when visiting Venice. The rooms are large and comfortable and nicely appointed with all of your modern amenities as you would expect from a luxury hotel. The location gives you an oasis once you have visited the crowds of Venice to escape in  a quiet meticulously maintained resort. You are on a beautifully maintained island which you can walk among 200 year old olive trees and spacious grounds. Once you stayed in Venice you will welcome the JW .

To hear you say that our resort is the best place to stay when in Venice is a major compliment. We really appreciate your generous comments about our large and comfortable rooms and beautifully maintained grounds.  I hope you had the chance to take part in on our Olive Oil Tasting tour. We love explaining to our guests the history of our 100 olive trees and how they grow! We also showcase different olive oils, including our own which is the only one produced in Venice and exclusively served at our Dopolavoro Dining Room.   Thank you for choosing to stay our Isola delle Rose and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
