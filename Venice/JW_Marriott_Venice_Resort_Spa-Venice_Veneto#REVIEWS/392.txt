Beautiful property on private island in Venice. Private water taxi to hotel. Front of house desk staff, Ilaria and Theo made my arrival extra special and seamless. Upgraded to villas with private concierge, very nice! Roof top pool overlooking Venice was amazing, thank you Antonio for the cocktail recommendations and sunglass cleaning services!!! Claudia made my sunset rooftop dinner extra special, I cannot day enough about this property, canâ€™t wait to go back !! Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
