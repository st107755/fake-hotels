All we can say is WOW!  Ok I lied..... from start to finish this was truly an amazing experience..... from the entry via water taxi into the JAMES Bond cave, to the sumptuous room with glass everywhere and a tub for two, to the breakfast and dinner both inside and out.  My only regret is we were ther only 4 days.... The staff and service was amazing not only warm and friendly but they learned our name and greeted is from day 1.   Marriott it is not often that I can say your properties blow me away but you did it.  We were impressed.   For those considering don't hesitate the experience..... the island brings after a long day of sight seeing and shopping with throngs of people.  Jump on the chance before this location is found out and the prices skyrocket.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 2, 2017Dear Scott P, thank you so much for your generous feedback. We appreciate your kind comments about our impressive facilities, warm and friendly staff and peaceful resort.  As you mentioned, we believe having the ability to escape Veniceâ€™s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit, our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
