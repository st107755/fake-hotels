I really liked this hotel. Best marriott I have stayed at. Beautiful buildings and island. Would I go back yes for sure, despite a few grumbles that if they weren't there would make this one of my favourite hotels:  1. Food prices are pretty ridiculous. 34 euros for meat pasta.  2. Shuttle to San Marco is too slow. The accoutants must be in charge and have worked out they save 25p if they drive really slowly. The one thing my wife didn't like about the hotel was that it was too far away and now wants to try cipriani! Marriott doh! 23 mins when I timed it. Its not because of regulations because every time we were the slowest boat with everyone else overtaking. Just my opinion, but spend the 25p and try to give the impression you are close rather than making the distance worse!  â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
