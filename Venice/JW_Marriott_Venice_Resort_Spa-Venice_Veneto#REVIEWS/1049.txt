Our room was beautiful and the beds were comfortable. The hotel food was GREAT, and there was free transportation into Venice from the hotel. Marco, one of the waiters at the pool was SO incredibly kind and serving. He made us feel comfortable and relaxed. The rooftop pool was amazing, and everyone's favorite aspect of this hotel. It is just a beautiful place.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 14, 2016Dear Haley A, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful rooms, comfortable beds, good food, incredibly kind staff and amazing rooftop pool.  Did you have the chance to dine at our Sagra Rooftop restaurant? You might be interested to hear that besides the regular menu, we also offer a special menu from the Cicchetti Bar, which are Venetian-style tapas. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden. One of my favorite dining experiences is enjoying these Venetian-style tapas while overlooking the dramatic skyline of the Lagoon during sunset at our rooftop.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
