This hotel is very nicely located on its private island allowing you to relax from the bustling Venice. It is a modern, comfortable hotel with very friendly staff. The private shuttle boat takes you to Venice San Marco within 25 minutes and departs every half hour from and to the hotel.  Choose a high floor room and ask for a balcony with view over the lagoon or garden.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 1, 2017Dear pilchen, thank you so much for your positive feedback.
