No doubt about it, this is a beautiful piece of property. They have their own water taxis very 30 mins to and from St. Marco Square to the property. BUT....we booked months in advance and very very clear about the fact that we needed a room to accomodate 4. Very disappointed to learn that meant carting in two roll-a-ways! We tried it for one night, it was just not acceptable. They told us we were upgraded. Yet, the bathroom was much smaller, we lost our balcony, and STILL had a roll-away! When the a/c started dripping in the room on the carpet and the shower started to back-up, we had had enough!! Finally we got the "villa" which is probably what we should have had from the beginning. The hotel was not crowded, there was no reason for,them not to try to accomodate us as best â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
