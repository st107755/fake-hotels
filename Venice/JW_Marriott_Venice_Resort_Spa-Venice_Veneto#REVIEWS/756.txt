We are delighted to hear that you and your family enjoyed your stay at our resort. We appreciate your kind comments about our peaceful and quiet atmosphere, luxurious facilities, friendly and attentive staff and nice spa.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our property provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very kids-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as an amazing Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
