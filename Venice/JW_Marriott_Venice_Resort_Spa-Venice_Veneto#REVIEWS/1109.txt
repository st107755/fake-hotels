We just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel. The resort itself is beautiful, as are the rooms. The staff is so friendly (literally everyone we saw greeted us or smiled). Special shot out to Luca, who was so helpful and started our stay off on the right foot! We also want to thank Nicola by the family pool who was great!   We found the shuttle to be uncrowded when we needed it and it was a pleasure to come back to the quiet grounds after being in busy, hot Venice.   We got massages at the spa and that too was excellent. The spa facilities (vitality pool, hammam, etc) were awesome!   We hope to come again soon!

We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful resort and friendly staff.   I am also thrilled that you enjoyed your treatments at our luxurious GOCO Spa. It is such a wonderful experience and you can spend a whole day getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan salt wall sauna, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we look forward to welcoming you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
