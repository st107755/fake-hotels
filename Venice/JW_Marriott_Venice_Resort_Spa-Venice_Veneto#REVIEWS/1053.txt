This resort was fantastic.  Customer service was superior.  Having the free water shuttle to St Mark's square was a real benefit.  Only wish I had more time to just be at the resort to fully enjoy ALL it has to offer. The Infiniti pool was breathtaking with its views.  There is a more family friendly pool for the swim/Splash time.  Truly and elegant and peaceful resort experience.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 13, 2016Dear Debbie M, thanks so much for your review. We are grateful for your kind comments about our fantastic resort, superior customer service and amazing pools with breathtaking views. We also appreciate you saying that you had a truly elegant and peaceful resort experience.  Hopefully when you visit us again for a longer stay you will have the chance to check out our GOCO Spa. It is such a wonderful experience and you can spend a whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
