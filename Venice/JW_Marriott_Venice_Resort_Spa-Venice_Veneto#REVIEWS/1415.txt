I had read some poor reports about this hotel. They didn't put me off from coming (nor should it you), i did though keep these in mind during our stay.  Overall I would say that many of the negative reviews cannot be substantiated. one review stated that the water taxi took longer (or others shorter) than others???? well i took my stop watch and the guy was right... none of them took the same time. Who really has a problem with that? look at it from the other side - not many places bring you, at no additional cost to San Marco from your private island in the lagoon.  on the island, what a place. absolutely beautiful, well maintained and all in good working order. It ought to be, its new.  Food, from all locations excellent, and I mean it. Breakfast = everything you could everâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 7, 2015Dear Stewart,  Thank you for your feedback on your recent stay.
