All around amazing! Luigi at Saporri Cooking School was superb for the pasta class. Stayed in a maisonette suite with private plunge pool and could not have been more pampered. Everyone from checking in to checking out was helpful and incredible! 5 star... would give 6 if I could... the water taxis leave every 30 minutes directly to St Marks square and so peaceful being out of the city but still just 15 min from center of Venice by water taxi.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
