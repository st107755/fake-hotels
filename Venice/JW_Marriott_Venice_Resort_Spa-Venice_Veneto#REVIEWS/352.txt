A fabulous island only 20 minutes by boat from St Mark, away from the crowd, ideal to relax after a day visiting churches, palaces and museums. An unexpected environment, with the same atmosphere you would find on a Maldivian private island. Walk in the park and in the olive grove, sunbathe and swim in the roof pool with a breathtaking view on Venice and its lagoon, have some pampering in the spa, enjoy the delicious food. Staff is young, friendly and very professional and will make your stay unforgettable.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
