The J W Marriott Venice Resort and Spa is properly one of the best hotels my partner and I have ever stayed in. The rooms are great the grounds are stunning with so many restful places to sit and enjoy the piece and quite. The food is to die for, but most of all is the service, the staff cannot do enough for you always on hand with a friendly smile and never to rushed to have a chat. A special regards to not only all the staff, especially: Maurizio Di Blase the Restaurant Manager, Paolo Parlavecchia The Night Manager. Giampiero and Antonio our waitors. and lastly the Porter Massimo. All in all a great Holiday.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 22, 2016Dear maj0rchange, thanks for your review.
