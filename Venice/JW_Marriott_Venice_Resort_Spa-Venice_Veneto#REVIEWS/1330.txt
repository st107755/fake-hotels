Fantastic location on its own island in the lagoon south of Venice. 20 minute boat shuttle runs every half hour of so direct to St Marks Square.  Hotel only opened in March 2015 so fittings and furniture are all in excellent condition.  On arrival, we were upgraded to a junior suite. Good start!  The room was spacious and plush. Comfortable bed, views over the gardens and lagoon. Beautifully finished bathroom with a deep bath tub for a luxury soak.  Roof terrace with small pool with spa seats built in, panoramic views of the lagoon and Venice beyond. Rooftop bar an ideal place to watch the sunset.  Restaurant in hotel on 4th floor was not bad value considering the captive audience. Good food and friendly service.  All in all, a real treat and fantastic taste of opulence.
