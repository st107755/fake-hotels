We are delighted that you and your wife had a beautiful experience at our magical Isola delle Rose.   It also sounds like you were able to enjoy our lush grounds. Our century-old park is a hectare expanse of greenery â€“ a mixture of old trees and soft lawns, which is impossible to find elsewhere in Venice.
