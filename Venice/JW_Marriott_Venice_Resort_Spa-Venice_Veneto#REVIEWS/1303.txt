The james bond entrance by boat is truly out of a movie. The hotel is on its own island on isla de la rosa. 20 min boat ride. Ideal for retreat with the cedar trees park surrounding it. Nice for jogging around the island too. But it is out of the city itself. In case of fog (winter) you can be stranded as no taxi boat will take you there. When we arrived, there was no one to help with luggage. And there are stairs. So for a 5 stars, it just lost one... Service is ok, efficient but not done with a smile. No particular charm besides its island location. The building is not romantic but the park around it is. Can be over expensive seeing the average service, specially if you are on holiday and looking to be served.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Mar 20, 2016Dear Gemmayzetraveller, thanks for taking the time to write a review.
