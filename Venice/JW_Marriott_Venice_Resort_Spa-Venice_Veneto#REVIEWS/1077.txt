I travel for work and stay at 80+ nights per year at 15-20 hotels in US, Europe and Asia. I was so pleasantly surprised with this resort on my family vacation with my wife and our four children. In terms of experience, it is one of the top places I would select for a family trip. Head and shoulders above any Marriott or ritz property. Own private island overlooking Venice San Marco square with space to relax. Great kids club. Several pools including a rooftop infinity pool and bar overlooking Venice San Marco. Private 2 story villas w own pool and free private boat to Venice every half hour. One 39 euro resort charge includes kids club for four children with cooking classes, mask painting and many other activities, free bikes on the Resort island and excursions to lace and glass…Read moreDate of stay: July 20161 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 4, 2016Dear Sergey12345678, thank you so much for your wonderful review. We are absolutely thrilled that you and your family enjoyed staying at our magical Isola delle Rose. It really means a lot to us that our resort is your wife’s favorite property.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as an amazing Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
