This is a fantastic property!  I'd give 4.5 stars out of 5 if that was an option.    Positives features include: 1).  Friendly staff in all areas!  Everyone was super nice in the hotel and the restaurants including GIARDINO RESTAURANT/Grill (by the family pool) and Cucina restaurant for breakfast.   We felt welcome and appreciated.   2).  Gorgeous grounds away from the Venice hustle yet convenient to get there when desired. 3). Nice family pool and great gym. (We viewed the rooftop pool and it looked great but we didn't use it because we had our 9 year old son with us) 4). We had a loft villa, which was extremely nice; very spacious and private outside patio area.  5). The breakfast quality and variety at Cucina is amazing!  Staff is great too.  Outstanding way to start the day!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
