The hotel is a great place to stay away from the Venice crowds, rooms very comfortable, rooftop pool is a great place to be and great views, not many beds though so go early and stay for the day.  Drinks were expensive but this is a JW Marriott on in its own island, best thing was the staff they could not have been more helpful ask for Max on reception who sent a special birthday gift to our room, get the breakfast included in your rate.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 27, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for your feedback on your recent stay!
