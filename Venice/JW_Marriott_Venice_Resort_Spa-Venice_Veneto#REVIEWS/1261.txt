We stayed here in May 2015 and I would return in a heartbeat! The entrance is breath taking have your camera at the ready, the staff were super polite and friendly. We had a junior suite and it was a great size, beautiful finish and two nights was not enough. The breakfast will set up you up for a day exploring on the main island. Dinner upstairs was great the service was lovely.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 12, 2016Dear MissBoots82, we appreciate you taking the time to write a review.
