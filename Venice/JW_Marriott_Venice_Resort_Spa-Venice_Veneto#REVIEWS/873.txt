Booked this hotel direct and spoke to an English speaking customer service team who were very helpful. We booked our VIP transfer (the hotel offer this service but I used my regular company), and arrived in style to be warmly greeted by the hotel (pier) staff. We were lucky enough to be given 2 rooms at the front of the hotel over looking Venice which, although there was no balcony, the views were amazing and the balcony wasn't missed. I am not going to itemize every thing this hotel has to offer as it is wrote on their website and and on this very rare occasion the information is precise...In a nutshell this hotel boasts and delivers an excellent customer service team....excellent facilities with friendly helpful staff throughout that really do want you to have the best,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 29, 2016Dear 15ALF, thanks so much for your review.
