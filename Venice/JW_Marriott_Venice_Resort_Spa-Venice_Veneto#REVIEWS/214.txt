We booked this hotel for a longer stay in Venice so that we could have some chilled time as well as a city break. It was fantastic. The service was superb and venue and location were perfect. It was busy when we stayed so the pool area overlooking the city was full but we soon found the family pool area which was quiet and perfect for late afternoon relaxing and drinks after busy days exporling fabulous Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
