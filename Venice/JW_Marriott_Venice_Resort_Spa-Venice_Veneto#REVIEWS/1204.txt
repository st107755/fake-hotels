One of the most amazing hotels I have ever had the opportunity to stay! Not only is it in Venice on the lagoon, it is own its own, private island with transportation to/from the island to San Marco.

We are absolutely thrilled to hear you say that we are one of the most amazing hotels that you have ever stayed in. We are grateful for your generous comments about our luxurious facilities, relaxing grounds, spectacular rooms, delicious food and attentive and fabulous staff.  We hope that you had the chance to check out our Sapori Cooking Academy. The morning program we offer is such an unforgettable experience. The morning starts with meeting Chef Micki and travelling together via private water taxi to the colorful Rialto Market. He helps you choose the freshest ingredients to take back to the resort where he teaches how to prepare delicious dishes following the Venetian culinary tradition. Plus you get to enjoy the lunch that you helped prepare. It is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the local culture – I highly recommend it.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
