One of the strongest selling points of the resort is that itâ€™s located on its own picturesque, private island, Isola delle Rose, in the Venetian lagoon. As such, it is a peaceful and serene refuge from the bustling and sometimes overcrowded streets of Venice, and the perfect place to indulge in luxury after a day of sightseeing in the city.  Rooftop bar has great views!  The service is impeccable and the private apt with your own pool is the grand stay!Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 3, 2016Dear Patrick D, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We are grateful for your kind comments about our picturesque and peaceful island, great views and impeccable customer service.  I agree, I think one of the main benefits of staying on your own private island is the serene retreat our resort provides after a busy day in Venice. Venice is certainly an exciting and thrilling destination, with its vibrant culture and rich history as well as the hustle and bustle of its crowded streets but many of our guests tell us that they like being able to come back to our relaxing hotel after a full day on the main island.   Thank you for choosing to stay at our magical Isola delle Rose and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
