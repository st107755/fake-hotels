I would like to start with the only thing that made our stay at this hotel amazing. The bar and restaurant staff was amazing and very friendly. We had the luck to "catch" the same waiter several evenings in a row (his name was Teo). He was very nice, friendly and polite. The provided service was impeccable.

After reading your message carefully, it is clear to me why we failed to deliver a memorable experience and why the inconveniences experienced affected your overall perception of the property.  First of all, we are glad that you enjoyed the food and service quality, and that you particularly appreciated the breakfast buffet option delivered in our daily Cucina restaurant, as well as the beauty of the location and the room cleaneliness.  At the same time, we regret about the misunderstanding occurred during your stay in regards of the shuttle boat transportation, since during those dates, due to a private event, the shuttle service was stopped and dedicated to internal use only. However, I am glad to confirm that at the moment we are again extending a daily consistent service from and to Saint Mark's Square every thirty minutes.  Also, we would like to apologize for the disappointing departure experience, and about the fact that room features did not match your expectations and your needs. We have shared your valuable comments with all our Heads of Department and we will immediately take actions to avoid similar cases to reoccur in the future. Also, we will continue to focus on our customer service in order to deliver the finest luxury experience to all our guests.  Unfortunately we can not change your past experience now. May you decide to give us a second chance, please do not hesitate to contact us directly, and we will make sure that your next overall experience will be completely different.
