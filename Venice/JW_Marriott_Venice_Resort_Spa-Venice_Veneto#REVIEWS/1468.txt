Wow!  This was a quick get-away, but turned out to be a new "honeymoon weekend". The hotel is new, opened only in 2015, it occupies the whole island near Venice and totally stands up to its JW Marriott name. Everything - from check-in experience, to dinner arrangements and room's appointment was excellent. Staff was very accommodating and welcoming, we had our room ready and were taken there by check-in staff in person. Room was garden facing, but what a garden that was! Landscaped, with statues and fountains. The hotel has its own shuttle boat to and from Piazza St. Marco, which is very convenient. Many people take it off to have dinner in Venice. But the hotel was so great, we stayed on the ground for dinner and were rewarded for this. The restaurants on-site are excellent!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 4, 2015Dear Natalie,  How lovely it was to read your review of our JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa!
