The best way to arrive is by water taxi to the wet entrance of the hotel- very James Bond like! Its about 120 Euros from the airport for the taxi but well worth it. The hotel is just beautiful, its expensive but quality costs a lot in Venice. Fabulous breakfast and a very chic pool bar on the top floor. The staff are extremely helpful and polite. Most definitely stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 1, 2015Dear Steve,  How lovely it was to read your review of our JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa!
