We stayed for 3 days at JW Marriott and was very pleased with our stay.  Their  service is excellent and the staff is amazing.  The concierge is very helpful and give you many options and don't push any private tours on you.  They have their own Boat taxi service that leaves to St. Marc square about every 20 - 30 minutes and also brings passengers back.  They offer a large breakfast buffet. The only disappointment  was their rooftop restaurant Sagra which has a very limited menu and very expensive.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 10, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for your feedback on your recent stay!
