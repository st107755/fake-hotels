Venice itself is a bit boring. There's a terrible stink always and the pavements are dirty. Once you have done your gondola ride, and been ripped off, you are actually done!! BUT just stay at this hotel and don't leave at all!!! It is stunning. The service is impeccable. From meet and greet to everything in between. They even have sweets lined up in the lobby. Adults and kids alike kept taking all the sweets. Nothing at all to complain about here!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 4, 2015Dear Sir,  We are happy and proud to read your satisfaction!
