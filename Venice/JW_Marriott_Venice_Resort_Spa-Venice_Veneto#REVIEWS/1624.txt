We had 2 rooms in a separate building that were suite style and very large. One of the rooms had 2 bathrooms. I think we were the first guests to stay in these rooms. Everyone was clean and comfortable. We stayed two nights and the highlight was dinner at Dopolavoro our last night. It was opening night and we were their first guests. What a great dinner with incredible food and service.   Great place away from downtown Venice allowing you to "get away" from the crowds when you choose.   I highly recommend this hotel and would stay again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 3, 2015Dear Sir,  We would like to thank you for your feedback.
