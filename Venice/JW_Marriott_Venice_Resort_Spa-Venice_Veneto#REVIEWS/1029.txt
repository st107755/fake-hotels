A 15 minute water taxi ride from the centre, 40 minutes from the airport. This hotel is only 18 months old and therefore in excellent condition sitting on its own private island.  We stayed in a junior suite that was neutrally decorated and very comfortable approx 450 sq ft with a lovely terrace.  The hotel has 2 restaurants and a poolside grill. Very quiet and a perfect place to relax.  The hotel has a shuttle boat the the town every half an hour.  All in a very lovely stay and plenty to do in Venice.

We appreciate your generous comments about our stunning hotel, comfortable rooms and relaxing atmosphere.  I am delighted to hear that you were able to visit the charming islands of Murano, Burano and Torcello. The next time you stay with us, you should check out our Squero Tramontin tour to see how gondolas are made. This exclusive excursion via water taxi takes JW guests to the magical place where gondolas are built and repaired. It is an activity that I highly recommend to our guests – there is only one place like this in Venice.  Thank you for choosing to stay at our Isola delle Rose and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
