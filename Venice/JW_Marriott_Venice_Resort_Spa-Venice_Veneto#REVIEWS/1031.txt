This is a beautiful hotel on it's own island so it's great for a "get away" from the hustle and bustle.  You have to take a water taxi or free water "shuttle" to get to Venice itself (about a 10 minute ride) so that is the disadvantage.  The grounds were beautiful but didn't see too many roses considering the island is named after them!  The lobby was modern and white and rooms were spacious and also modern.  What I especially liked about the hotel were the staff; very gracious and personable;  especially  Gabriele Dispensa in the rustic coffee/pastry shop in the lobby area.  Such a kind and funny young Italian who made our day by taking the time to talk and converse and telling us about the area.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 21, 2016Dear Donna K, thanks for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful hotel, gorgeous grounds, modern and spacious rooms and gracious and personable staff.   Our Isola delle Rose has a rich history. Its position, halfway between the lagoon and sea, has given the island a special microclimate, which has encouraged the growth of plants and trees rare in Venice such as our 100 olive trees and inspired the establishment of a clinic of respiratory ailments at the beginning of the 20th century. We are proud of the historical roots of our private island and love to share the beauty of our grounds with our guests.  Thanks for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
