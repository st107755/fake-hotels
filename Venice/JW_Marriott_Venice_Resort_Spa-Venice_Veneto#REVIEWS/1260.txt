Absolutely stunning hotel, from the moment we arrived we have been showered with kindness and the property must be seen to truly understand the beauty. The taxis to and from the train stations and airport can be a tad pricey (100-200 euros each way) but once you are here there is a free shuttle to and from Piazza San Marco. Shoutout to Ali with room service, went above and beyond!! And second shoutout to Alesandro the concierge who found me immediately upon arriving and then took care of our every need! Wonderful hotel top to bottom. Can't wait to return and we haven't even left yet :)Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 15, 2016Dear Mazahir A, thank you so much for providing a review of your recent stay with us. We appreciate your kind comments about our stunning hotel and kind staff. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us.  We hope that you had the chance to check out our Sapori Cooking Academy. The morning program we offer is such an unforgettable experience. The day starts off meeting Chef Micki and travelling together via private water taxi to the colourful Rialto Market. He helps guests choose the freshest ingredients to take back to the resort where he then shows them how to prepare delicious dishes following the Venetian culinary tradition. Plus guests get to enjoy the lunch that they helped prepare. It is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the local culture â€“ I highly recommend it.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
