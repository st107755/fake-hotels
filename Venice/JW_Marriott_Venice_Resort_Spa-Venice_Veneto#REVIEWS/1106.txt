We spent 12 days in Italy (Venice, Florence and Rome) and this hotel was our favorite.  The rooms were lovely and spacious, and eclipsed only by the incredible service.  Our favorite concierge was Alessandro Amadio who not only helped us with places to see and restaurants, he also went out of his way to help us with our US to Italian electrical appliance conversions issue.  When our daughter's flat iron wouldn't work, he actually brought one in from home for her to use temporarily.  We were so surprised and delighted - we've traveled a lot and he's our favorite of all time.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 16, 2016Dear Connie C, thanks so much for your positive feedback.
