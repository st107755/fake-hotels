Beautiful modern property set on a lovely island with acres of open space for biking, jogging, etc. Love the idea of being able to spend the day at St. Marks shopping and sightseeing with the crowds and then  returning to the quiet and peacefulness of the island using their water shuttle service.  The entire staff was well-trained, friendly  and professional and very eager to please. Every single staff member that we encountered went out of their way to make sure that we were having a memorable experience.  Great breakfast buffet with everything imaginable and also eggs, etc. made to order.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 1, 2015Dear Sir,  Your feedback left us so proud and happy, that we would like to deeply thank you.
