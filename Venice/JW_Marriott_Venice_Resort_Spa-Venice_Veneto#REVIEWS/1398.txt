We are pleased to read you appreciated your Junior Suite room category;  we took note of your suggestion of highlighting that there are very few Junior Suites - like yours - which provides a wonderful direct view of Venice skyline, while the majority features a wide terrace overlooking the century-old park. We will make sure to better indicate this into our web-site and we would like to thank you for having suggested this to us. At the same time, we would like to reassure and confirm that all pictures featured into our web-site are real and have been taken using normal lens - not wide angled ones.   We would like to thank you as well for all of your comments and observations, which are actually constructive and are much appreciated as they are indeed crucial in supporting our improvement efforts.  We have shared your feedback among our Management Team.  We thank you again and hope to have the chance to welcome you back to Venice again.  Sincerest regards,  Linda Bertoni Marketing & Communication ManagerRead more
