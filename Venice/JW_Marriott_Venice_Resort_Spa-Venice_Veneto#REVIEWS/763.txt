We have been at this lovely resort since Saturday the dining experiences have been wonderful.   I really must compliment Giuseppe , he has been so helpful in assisting us in our dinner plans.   He is very knowledgeable about the offerings at each restaurant. He also has gone out of his way to make sure we enjoyed ourselves, he even made me a plate of his favorite pizzas on all you can eat pizza night.   Well done Giuseppe! We will definitely be back.  I also cannot forget the young lady who helped us in the deli, I think her name was Allicia. She made the best cappuccino and cafe americano   Great experience Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 24, 2017Dear Mmk7692, thank you for taking the time share feedback on your recent stay.
