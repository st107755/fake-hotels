Wow!  My husband & I have traveled the world and this JW was one of the nicest hotels we've stayed in.  We are Platinum Marriott and were immediately upgraded to a large suite.  It was extremely clean & looked brand new.  The walk in closet was huge, the terrace was the whole length of the suite & overlooked the beautiful grounds of the property.  The staff here was also phenomenal!Read moreDate of stay: October 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
