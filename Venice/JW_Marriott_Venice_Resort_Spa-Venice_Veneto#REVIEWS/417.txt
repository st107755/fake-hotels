We appreciate your kind comments about our friendly and hospitable staff, excellent customer service, beautiful atmosphere, tastefully decorated rooms and convenient shuttle service.

One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds.
