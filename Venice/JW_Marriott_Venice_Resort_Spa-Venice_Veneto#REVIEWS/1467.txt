One word, "FANTASTIC". This is an incredible hotel with an outstanding staff. At every touch point the hotel and staff have got it right. The service was top notch! The highlight of our stay was taking a cooking class with Chef Micki. We had such an wonderful experience with our first cooking class we ended up taking another one. Chef Micki is incredible. He makes cooking easy and fun. He truly took interest in our learning. My 14 year old son says it was the highlight of his trip thanks to Micki. If traveling to Venice, this hotel and a cooking class is a must.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 14, 2015Dear Heidi,  How lovely it was to read your review of our JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa!
