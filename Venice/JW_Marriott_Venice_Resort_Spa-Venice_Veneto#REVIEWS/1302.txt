I'd like to share my unforgettable  experience! I traveled with my family and it was our first visit to Venice that started from this great hotel! Hotel shuttle boat (new, very comfortable) brought us to the private island and the magic started! Such a nice personnel: warm welcome, room upgrade, very pleasant interaction upon check-in let us relax from the very first moment. Smiling and very friendly staff! Our room was perfect: spacious, with variety of amenities, mini-bar items, the nicest view from the room! The SPA with access only for adults. Prompt room service. Delicious breakfast that lets you enjoy peaceful morning and the difficulty to choose out of an excellent food variety, as you want to try everything!!! The shuttle boat goes to San Marco and back every 15-30â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Mar 20, 2016Dear Natalia M, thank you for taking the time to share your unforgettable experience at our resort. We are grateful for your generous comments about our fabulous hotel, friendly staff and spacious rooms.   I am glad that you were able to spend time in our picturesque park and gardens. One of the fun activities that we offer families when they stay on our private island is the opportunity to rent bikes (complimentary and included in the Resort package) for the day to explore our historical grounds. It really is a fun and memorable way to discover our Isola delle Rose.  Thank you for recommending us and we look forward to welcoming you and your family back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
