I visited with my wife and 2 children(7&14). The hotel is very clean, has beautiful grounds and a fun family pool. Chef Paolo has an amazing breakfast to get your day started properly. Easy to use shuttles directly to San Marco. Food in general was a little bit expensive, but far superior to the tourists traps we visited in Venice.

We are thrilled that you and your family enjoyed our magical Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your generous comments about our family-friendly resort, amazing breakfast and beautiful grounds.  We hope that your children had the chance to check out our Kids Club. When the team and I were brainstorming the activities for the Kids Club program, we wanted to offer something that would incorporate aspects of Italian culture so that the children would get to know the history and traditions of our beautiful country. Some of the activities that we are proud to offer families include Italian language lessons, creating and painting your own mini gondola and making Venetian masks.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
