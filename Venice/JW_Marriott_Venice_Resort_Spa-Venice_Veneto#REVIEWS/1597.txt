We stayed at this hotel for 1 night as we were going on a cruise and this was the "pre cruise hotel", the situation of this hotel is so lovely on an island with beautiful facilities, they offer regular water taxis, we had dinner there which was really good, and our room was beautiful, however our luggage did not turn up until 7pm and when you have been travelling and want a shower and change of clothes this was frustrating, we had to chase them for our luggage and was disappointed that we had to do this. However, despite this I would return here and hope by my next visit they will be more organised.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 31, 2015Dear Stephanie,  We would like to thank you for your kind feedback; we are happy to know that, overall, you liked our Resort and enjoyed your room, our food served for dinner and our complimentary shuttle service from and to St. Mark's Square.  We apologize for the delay in delivering your luggage; being part of a cruise ship group, we received over 400 pieces of luggage all together and some of them were missing guestsâ€™ name tags, making the delivery difficult for us.  We are aware that this cannot be a justification but please be assured that this is not our usual routine; kindly consider what happened an unlucky circumstance.  We hope to have the chance to welcome you back again to Venice soon, to our Isola delle Rose. We thank you and remain with our sincerest regards,  Linda Bertoni Marketing & Communication ManagerRead more
