My wife and I recently spent 3 nights at this magical place and we can not say enough good things about it. Besides it's beautiful location and grounds, which you might expect from a JW and that you can see on the web site, it was the service and the people working there that most impressed us. They we extremely helpful with pre planning but once we arrived they could not have been more friendly or helpful. They always greeted us by name and asked if everything was good. We had dinner at the gourmet restaurant which was a great experience and were greeted there by name as well. I have traveled a great deal for both business and pleasure globally and stayed in many high end hotels but this was one of the all time greats. Thanks to all those that made it so great.
