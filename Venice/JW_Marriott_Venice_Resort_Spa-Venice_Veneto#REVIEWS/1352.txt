Recently stayed here for 2 nights on our 1st stop in Italy. It was beautiful hotel! It pays to stay a nice hotel chain as it gives you some consistency. The [included] breakfast was wonderful. The free shuttle to San Marco was a great feature as well! Our favorite hotel of our trip thru Italy.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
