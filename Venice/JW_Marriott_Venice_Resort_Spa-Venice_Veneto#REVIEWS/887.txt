As a well travelled family, this hotel was a fantastic experience. We can not fault this hotel on any level. Travelling with a young son, the hotel did their best to make our experience pleasurable and accommodated each one of our requests as best they could, they even allowed us to dine at Dopolavoro their Michelin star resturant. The staff were great, in particular Laura, whom was our waitress at each one of our 4 breakfasts. She was always smiling, nothing was ever to difficult  and went above and beyond to make the start of our days great. We would highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 21, 2016Dear carlosheather, thanks so much for your review.
