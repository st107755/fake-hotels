We are sorry for the inconvenience experience, since we manage our guests' transactions very carefully in order to avoid possible billing errors such as double charges. May this happen, we always provide our maximum support in order to verify and refund our guests in a timely and efficient way following our core values and business principles. However, if our Accounting Team investigation does not lead to a billing error, we kindly clarify the charges with the card holder and the reason why we can not proceed with a possible refund.  In this case, may you need any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me directly on my business e-mail address and I will gladly follow up your case and provide you a prompt reply.
