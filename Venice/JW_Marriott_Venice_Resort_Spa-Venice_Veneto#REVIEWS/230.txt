The best thing clearly is that the Hotel is not in Venice but on a small island 20 min with the Hotel boat transfer away. We were traveling in Agust with friends and family with 5 kids so the pool was just THE thing you needed after the strenuous sightseeing during the day. Service was good, the only thing which was VERY annoying was that the kid in the parents' room was 150 Euro extra!!! Very nice surroundings and the park!Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
