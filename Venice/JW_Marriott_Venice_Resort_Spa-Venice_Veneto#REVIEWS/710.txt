What an experience! The JW Marriott Venice has the most remarkable staff and service. They make you feel welcomed as soon as the private shuttle drops you off on the private island.

We are delighted that you had an amazing experience with us! We appreciate your generous comments about our remarkable staff.   I am also happy to hear that you enjoyed the boat journeys to and from the resort into Venice proper.

All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager  Read more
