Really expensive resort in it's own island. The rides to Venice are nice. Resort itself is pretty big and the rooms are nice. However, for the price the service we got was not good. Next time in Venice we'll stay elsewhere.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 10, 2016Dear lela010, thank you for taking the time to write a review. We appreciate your kind comments about out big resort and nice rooms. However, I am very sorry to hear that you were disappointed with aspects of your stay with us. I really do sympathize with your feedback about Venice being an expensive place to visit overall, which is mainly due to the high cost of bringing everything in from the main land. Our resort is not the only subjected to elevated pricing â€“ most hotels located in our iconic city have a similar issue.  The satisfaction of our guests is our highest priority so I welcome you to contact our Director of Room Operations, Anna Gutova, to discuss your experience in more detail. You can email her on info.venice@jwmarriotthotels.com.  We hope that you will consider giving us another opportunity to demonstrate the standards and level of service that we are known for.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
