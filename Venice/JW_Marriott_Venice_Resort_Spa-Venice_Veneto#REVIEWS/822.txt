My wife and I recently enjoyed four nights at the Marriott, Venice, and it was fantastic. It's a beautiful, tranquil island hotel, about twenty five minutes (via complimentary shuttle boats that go to and from St Mark's Square every half hour) from Venice's main attractions. Upon arrival, and when mentioning we had a Marriott rewards card, we were upgraded to a villa outside the main building.

We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful and tranquil island hotel, attentive staff, top quality rooms, nice gardens and lovely spa.  As you mentioned, there is so much to do at our magical Isola delle Rose. When the team and I were organizing the excursions that we wanted to provide our guests, we thought of all the things that would be part of the ultimate travel experience of Italy. From interactive cooking classes at our Sapori Cooking Academy to a tour of a traditional Murano glass-making factory, we wanted to showcase our passion for Italy and highlight some of the wonderful and fascinating aspects of its culture and history.   Thank you for recommending us and we hope to see you and your wife again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
