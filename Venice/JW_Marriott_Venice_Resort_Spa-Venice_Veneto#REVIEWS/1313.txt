Too expensive for the services, too far from venice, 20-minute journey by the shuttle boat with an inconvenient schedule of shuttles, poor breakfast service, small room with poor view, the spa is super far from the main building and crazily expensive. All in all, don't go there, too expensive for the services offered.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
