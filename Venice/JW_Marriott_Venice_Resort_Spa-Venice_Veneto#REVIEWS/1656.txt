It's just opened one week ago but really it worth to stay in this resort. It's private island 20 minutes away from main Venice activities and the hotel has hourly shuttle to San Marco square. I really recommend this outstanding resort for those looking for relax and privacy away from the crowded areas within Venice. The guest Relation manager, Luca is very friendly person and very helpful. He took us short tour around the hotel and services available and it was great and useful information. Sure will comeback again to enjoy it.
