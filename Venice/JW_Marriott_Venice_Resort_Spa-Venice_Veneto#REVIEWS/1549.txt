Being fortunate enough to travel out of the USA often and getting married in Europe over 3 years ago I know how difficult it can be to accommodate a wedding. We arrived for a 4 night stay and Steven from guest relations was able to set up a small but beautiful wedding for my brother in law in just 48 hours!!! The grounds on this property are amazing. Away from the hustle and traffic of the city this island property has everything to offer. It's such a peaceful and beautiful place you really do get to unwind and feel totally at peace. The service matches there property from he pool side service to the amazing attention the concierge staff has to finding you the best restaurants in town. Forever holding a place in my heart this is a MUST when looking for a place to stay in Venice!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
