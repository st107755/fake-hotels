I haven't even arrived in Italy and the booking agents at this hotel has pissed me off! I booked this wretched hotel online and mistakenly chose a rate that does not accept changes. First off, my booking is in a year! Second, the rates are mashed together and I can't even see which rate has a no refund policy or which rate can be changed!   I'm royally pissed at the way they treat me as a customer of this hotel. When I stayed at the Ritz shanghai they bent over backwards to help me with my booking and even called me to make sure I was okay. Not here. They rely on the fact that this is a new property and snub its customers.   NOT RIGHT JW MARRIOTT!  You have lost a customer for this horrible experience. Just to make a buck, you're willing to rape your loyal customers.
