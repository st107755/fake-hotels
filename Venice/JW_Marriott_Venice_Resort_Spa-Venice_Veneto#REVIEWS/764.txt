We checked in yesterday after a week in Tuscany, from the start our experience has been nothing short of great.   Carlos Apral is a shining star at this resort. He completely exemplifies the Marriott employee. He is a true asset to this resort.   We are celebrating our anniversary and were surprised with a bottle of champagne in our room to celebrate.   The grounds are beautiful and well taken care of.   The shuttle to Venice was a quick 20 minute trip and works every half hour.   The rooms are well maintained and very clean.   We will definitely come back, what a great experience.   Carlos and team, thank you!
