First night at the JW Marriott Venice, what an amazing property! We decided to get a late night drink and bite at Sagra. Immediately we were approached and welcomed with Italian hospitality by a friendly and attentive server named Turgut, he got us the best table and our drink orders promptly. Amazing service. He recommended the Negroni, which went perfect with night. We are very appreciative of the hospitality and will definitely visit again...Grazie!
