This hotel can only be appreciated by seeing it!  You must travel by boat as it is an island. The hotel itself is nice with a few restaurants. The deli is quaint but the rooftop one is spectacular.   There are 2 pools one for adults. There is a church on the grounds and a separate reception area. There are several family activities such as soccer, ping pong and targets.  This was a wonderful hotel with nice views. The staff was very nice and they offer free shuttle to town. They were just starting the shuttle to the train. But it runs in the morning only. They hope to increase this service.

We are grateful for your generous comments about our wonderful hotel, nice views, fun family activities and attentive staff.  With regards to your comments about an early shuttle service, you will be interested to know that starting on June 10th of this year we have incorporated six complimentary shuttles from our resort to Piazzale Roma for those customers who need to leave the resort early in the morning. Once in Piazzale Roma customers can easily reach the airport by taxi/bus or just walk a few steps to the Venice train station. They can even take a morning walk to explore Venice as well. This shuttle is complimentary and it operates on a first come first serve basis. Please note that there is no service from Piazzale Roma to the JW Marriott Venice as well as from the resort to Piazzale Roma in the afternoon. On a side note the shuttle which operates between our resort and San Marco continues to operate on its regular schedule.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
