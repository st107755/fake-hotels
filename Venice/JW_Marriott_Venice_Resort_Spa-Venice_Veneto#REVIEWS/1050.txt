We arrived for a long weekend only to be told that our reservation had been cancelled by Expedia. They obviously never told us so we were quite upset. Yet the hotel manager put things right and gave us an upgraded room. Breakfast was fantastic as well. Beautiful grounds. But be aware, you are a 25mins boat ride from St Marks Square away. That wasn't a problem for us but make sure you consider that in your plans.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 13, 2016Dear SwissMountainGoat, thank you so much for your review.
