This is the place to go if you love to visit Venice, to have a fantastic view of Venice and if you enjoy the privacy. The hotel is on the private island Isola delle Rose a 20 minutes boat ride from St. Markâ€™s Square and you free shuttle is offered through out the day. Due to my job I notice attention to detail.  A dinner at the  2-Michelin Dopolavoro Dining Room should not be missed. Staff are trained in service of excellence through out the hotel. They without exception took the extra step to be helpful and genuinely enjoyed doing so. We can't wait to come back, and have already recommended the hotel to several of our friends.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
