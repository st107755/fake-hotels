Great place to making camp for visiting Venice and, fundamentally, far from the madding crowd. Classy but relaxed atmosphere and great facilities. Dining on the expensive side and average quality (did not try the dopolavoro though). But at the end of the story if you stay at the rooftop  restaurant you pay for the view and the sunset which are probably among the best in town. Buffet breakfast very traditional and not worth the price. Opt for the La Dispensa instead and Simone will treat you like at home (and I was born in Venice so I'm a tough critic).Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
