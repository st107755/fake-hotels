Wow what a hotel.  We have just had a very special 3 nights at the hotel.  We have throughly enjoyed our stay.  Our room with a small pool was perfect and lots of space.  Breakfast was a highlight of the day for our boys.  Lots to choose from and eggs cooked to order.  The bars made fabulous cocktails.  I cut my foot one day and nothing was to much trouble, everyone was very kind and very professional first aid.  We all enjoyed our trips in and out of Venice.  Having read other reviews we got to the boat 10 mins early each time  and had no problems.  We had a lovely stay and would recommend the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 22, 2016Dear HampshireMummy, thanks so much for your review.
