The JW Marriott in Venice is an absolutely beautiful property. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left three days later, we were Amazed at the beauty. It was also a welcome relief to be outside the busy city of Venice, but yet only 20 minutes away on a very relaxing and peaceful boat ride. The staff at the hotel was exceptional and made the visit really special. There were so many employees, you never needed to look far to get help. We felt that every employee really wanted us to enjoy our visit, every employee would greet Us as we passed. After we got in from the US, we were exhausted and went up to the rooftop pool which has absolutely incredible views. It does not have a lot of seating but we found that people came and went often, so that seats were always openingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
