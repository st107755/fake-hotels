I went with my parents, wife and 2y daughter.   The place is amazing with great views and sumptuous architecture.   What it lacks is consistent service.  The good treatment when we arrived turned into disappointment when we found out our room had an issue with the AC and they gave us a hard time to move us to a different room.   The same happened on the restaurant. We had a great meal on the first night so we decided to repeat the following night. We were served by a Maitre D who certainly didn't deserve to hold the title. I had to personally take plates off our table and request that we were served by the waiter we had on the night before to salvage our night.   These were a few of the issues that compromised the whole experience which is a pity because the property is greatâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Director of Sales at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 22, 2015Dear Valued Guest,  Many thanks for sharing your feedback.
