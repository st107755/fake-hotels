The hotel is only 2 yea4s old and is huge and very modern. It has its own private island Isola Rose and you ride a free shuttle from the St Mark square. It takes about 25 min. It is worth the trip. It has an infinity pool that outlooks the Lagoon. The staff is incredible  and has the only Michelin restaurant in VeniceRead moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 3, 2016Dear Marilena B, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our modern hotel, relaxing atmosphere and incredible staff.  Our resort is also a culinary destination in Venice – only six months after its opening Dopolavoro obtained its first Michelin star under the leadership of one of Italy’s most celebrated chefs, Giancarlo Perbellini and his team. What is offered is a traditional but unique gastronomic dining experience. The restaurant is surrounded by our organic botanical gardens, which not only provide guests with a beautiful setting, but also a wide variety of produce that we use in our dishes. It is a luxury dining experience that is not to be missed!   Thank you for choosing to stay at our magical Isola delle Rose and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
