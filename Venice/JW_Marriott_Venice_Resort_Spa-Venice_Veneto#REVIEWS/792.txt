We appreciate your kind words about our prompt shuttle service and friendly and helpful staff.   However, I am sorry to hear that there were aspects of your stay that you felt warranted improvement. Our resort is unique in the sense that it is located on its own private island, away from the hustle and bustle of Venice. Our secluded and peaceful location is one of our strongest assets as well as our first-class facilities such as our GOCO Spa (the largest in Venice) and our Michelin-starred restaurant, Dopolavoro. In addition, every decision we made when designing our resort experience and activity program supports our desire to deliver intuitive personal service in an authentic and crafted environment.  The satisfaction of our guests is our highest priority so I welcome you to contact our Director of Room Operations, Anna Gutova, if you would like to discuss your experience in more detail. You can email her on info.venice@jwmarriotthotels.com.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
