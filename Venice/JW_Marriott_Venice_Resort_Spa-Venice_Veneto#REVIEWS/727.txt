The hotel is located approximately 20 minutes from the main center of venice by boat. It's better as it's quiet. It's modern and comfortable place to stay. There's a free boat from/to the hotel every half an hour and until midnight. The rooms are amazing and clean. I took the junior sweet and it was amazing with a great view and nice balcony. The staff is wonderful as well. "Romeo", "Chiarra", and "Ommar" were very helpful and nice.

We appreciate your generous comments about our modern and comfortable resort, amazing rooms and wonderful staff.  The next time you stay with us we hope that you will have the chance to check out some of the activities and excursions that we offer at our resort such as our Sapori Cooking Academy, which is a big hit with our guests. The morning program we offer is such an unforgettable experience. The day starts off with meeting our Chef and travelling together via private water taxi to the colorful Rialto Market. He helps you choose the freshest ingredients to take back to the resort where he teaches how to prepare delicious dishes following the Venetian culinary tradition. Plus, you get to enjoy the lunch that you helped prepare. It is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the local culture â€“ I highly recommend it.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
