A real gem...this hotel was luxurious and the staff were superb.For medical reasons  we needed to obtain for 3 days a wheelchair or our Venice trip would have been spoilt. Alessio and his concierge team were superb and helped to make our celebratory holiday  so so special...Thank you. The room was excellent and very comfortable and the surroundings outstanding...recommend very highly.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
