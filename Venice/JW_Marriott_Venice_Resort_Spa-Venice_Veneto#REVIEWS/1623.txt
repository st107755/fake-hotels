Stayed at this hotel for four nights. Absolutely fantastic in every way.  Breakfast was amazing, room spotless, all the staff bent over backwards nothing was to much trouble. Would never stay anywhere else in Venice again. Special mention for the two young men behind the bar as they were so lovely, enthusiastic, welcoming and so proud of their bar.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 3, 2015Dear Clare,  How lovely it was to read your review of our JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa!
