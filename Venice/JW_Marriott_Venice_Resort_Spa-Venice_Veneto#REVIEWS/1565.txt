My wife and I had a long weekend here for her birthday. In many ways it's one of the harder reviews I've done, because this is a resort with a real split personality massive highs, a few lows and some things I put down to it being very new.  THE HOTEL itself is built on its own island in the lagoon and it is beautifully landscaped. The reception area is very stylish & contemporary and the staff on arrival were very welcoming.  OUR ROOM (junior suite) overlooked some lovely gardens and the room was well appointed, with the quietest aircon I think I have (n)ever heard. Nice sized room, separate rain shower, toilet & bath and Roberto Cavalli toiletries make it feel very luxe. Slight niggle with water pressure in shower, but not a showstopper.  RESTAURANT we ate in Sagra on 2 nightsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
