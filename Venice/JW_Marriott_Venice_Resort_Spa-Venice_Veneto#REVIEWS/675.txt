Stayed here one night before joining a Regent, 7 seas cruise. Room was Ok, Facilities great as was the setting. Free shuttle to Venice. Food very expensive, but nice. Over charged in the pool restaurant, but the biggest disappointment was being checked out by housekeeping before the checkout time! We returned to our room before checkout to find the room had been cleared and cleaned, and my husbands shorts had been bundled away in a bag on the cleaning trolley!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 6, 2017Dear Karen J, thank you for taking the time to write a review. We are grateful for your kind comments about our great facilities and nice food.  I have noticed that many guests plan a trip to Venice for only one or two nights, but the feedback I have received from all of them afterwards is that they wished they stayed longer. Our guests are pleasantly surprised by the many activities that we have as well as our amazing facilities, such as the GOCO Spa. We always encourage our guests to book a longer stay â€“ at least four or five nights so that they can experience all the wonderful things that we offer.  With regards to your comments on housekeeping, I have spoken to the team and we working towards enhancing this aspect of our offering. The satisfaction of our guests is our top priority so I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
