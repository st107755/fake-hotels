I have never usually been a person to write reviews, but I was so inclined by the amazing hospitality I received from Gabriele, Alexandru and Vincenzo. I can not thank them enough for making my visit such a memorable and comfortable stay. It has been an absolute pleasure, food was amazing which had been recommended to me personally by Gabriele. The spa was exceptional and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the marriot. Also if you require a recommendation on what to drink look no further than Alexandru. And feel confident that Vincenzo will make you a drink that will cater to your personal taste!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 16, 2017Dear Zack H, thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience at our magical Isola delle Rose.
