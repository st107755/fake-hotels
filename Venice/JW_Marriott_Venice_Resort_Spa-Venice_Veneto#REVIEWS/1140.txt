Great resort.  Staff is amazing and resort is very relaxing. The spa is great and take advantage of the 35 euro for two hours to just enjoy the amenities. They have a sauna, steam room indoor/outdoor pool and lounges.  The Sagra restaurant is good and the staff friendly. Our first waitress (Ilaria) was very knowledgable about how to get to the places we wanted to see. We actually like the snack menu outlay the pool best.  Rooms are a nice size and very clean.  Housekeeping staff did a good job.
