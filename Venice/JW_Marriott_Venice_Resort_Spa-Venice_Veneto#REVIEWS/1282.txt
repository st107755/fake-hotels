We stayed here for a couple nights in July 2015. Overall, this is a nice property. It is very modern against the backdrop of Venice and, if you hadn't arrived by boat, you sort of feel as if you could be in a W somewhere... That being said, it does have beautiful grounds and a nice rooftop pool. Our room was spacious and well kept. My major complaint would be that it seemed like they were still figuring out how to workout the kinks and properly operate the hotel. The lobby would often be overwhelmed with people seeking assistance and/or complaining and the staff could barely keep up. Given that it hadn't been open too long, this is somewhat expected and hopefully they've worked much of this out by now.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Mar 30, 2016Dear nycitygal_10002, thank you so much for your review.
