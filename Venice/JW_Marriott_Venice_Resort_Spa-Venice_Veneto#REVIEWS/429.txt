Wonderful service - friendly and so helpful and the facilities were great. Erica and the Concierge, Eros (?) deserve special mention but without exception, the staff was wonderful and the hotel wonderful. It's a 15 min water shuttle drive from St Marks. A bastion of peacefulness at the end of a crazy, albeit wonderful, day of touring Venice.  The shuttle is free and runs every half hour from 8:30 am to midnight. The facilities at the hotel were wonderful. We were fortunate enough to stay at the Villa Rosa - it's a whole house - beautiful and beyond comfortable.  The breakfasts are excellent. We had a lovely time at this lovely hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 16, 2017Dear rimavh, thank you for your positive feedback. We appreciate your generous comments about our wonderful service, friendly and helpful staff and wonderful facilities.  We are so proud of the beautiful design of our 19 buildings on our private island, which are the work of the renowned Italian architect Matteo Thun. His main focus was to integrate the contemporary elements of the existing buildings to showcase their unique history and personality, while at the same time enhancing the architectural heritage of our location.  Thank you for choosing to stay at the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
