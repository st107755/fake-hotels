We spent two nights at the JW Marriott in Venice.  We had a fantastic time and the resort was very special with everything you would expect from a world class resort.  If I had any complaints, it would be the set up charge at the restaurants.  $7 a person just to sit down.  They would be better off building it in their rates.  Just leaves a bad taste (no pun intended) when a resort of this caliber charges to use the restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 13, 2016Dear jmw10110205, thanks for your feedback. We are delighted to hear that you had a fantastic time at our world-class resort. We hope that you were able to check out our award-winning GOCO Spa. The views that we have from our treatment rooms and our pools are incredible! Our spa is such a hit with our guests that we now offer a day pass, which includes the use of our sauna, bio-sauna, hammam and yoga gardens, along with our indoor and outdoor pools. We definitely recommend checking it out the next time you visit us.  With regards to your comment on the cover charge of 5€ per guest at our restaurants, this is a common charge in many dining establishments in Italy. This charge can be compared to a set-up fee for the table and also includes bread.  Thank you for choosing to stay at our Isola delle Rose and we hope to welcome you back again soon – this time for a longer stay.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
