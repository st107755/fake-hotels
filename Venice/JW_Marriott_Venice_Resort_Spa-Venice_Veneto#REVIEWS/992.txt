The hotel and staff were amazing, what you would expect for Marriott. The rooms and grounds were well maintained and the staff were on the ball and always at your service. One thing I was slightly disappointed about is the size of the family pool, and also that kid's were not allowed to swim in the infinity pool. I still rate this five stars as Venice is more of a city break. Overall a great hotel , Marriott has done it again!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 9, 2016Dear Harrystreats, thanks for your positive feedback.
