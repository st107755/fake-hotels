A beautiful hotel with really nice staff and hospitality. Made the stay in Venice a lot more fun and comfortable. The room was very spacious. The hotel has a nice gym and running track around the hotel. The hotel is a 15-20 mind ferry ride from the city and the hotel has a regular ferry service throughout the day. The hotel is really quiet and personal - a much needed break from the city. Recommended for everyone.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 24, 2016Dear akshitajain, thanks so much for taking the time to write a review. We appreciate your generous comments about our beautiful hotel, nice staff and spacious rooms.  We hope you had the chance to check out our GOCO Spa. It is such a wonderful experience and you can spend a whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thanks for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back again in the near future.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
