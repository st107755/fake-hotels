We appreciate your kind comments about our unique location, large and nicely decorated rooms, beautiful facilities and great views.  I think our private island and luxurious facilities are a perfect venue for company events. Our historic gardens are one of the most picturesque locations with its scenic 360-degree views of Venice. We have hosted some weddings, conferences and high-profile events at our park and the feedback has been amazing.

Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
