We appreciate your generous comments about our luxurious resort, incredible rooftop and convenient shuttle service.  I agree, our Sagra Rooftop restaurant and pool offers one of the best vantage points to admire breathtaking 360-degree views of Venice and the Lagoon. It is also the ideal place to watch the beautiful Venetian sunset.
