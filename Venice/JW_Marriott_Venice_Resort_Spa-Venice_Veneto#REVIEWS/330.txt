My husband and I stayed at this resort for our 2 year anniversary. We absolutely loved this resort on its own private island. We stayed in a room with a private pool and sitting area, it was like a small backyard. The resort has a nice adult pool, with a fantastic view of Venice. They have areas of play which include badminton, soccer and football, we enjoyed a day of play. The grounds are beautiful with lush vegetation and room for running. The gym is large and well equipped for a nice workout and steam.  The very short boat ride into Venice was an easy ride back and forth, we liked not being directly in Venice.  The food was Ok but we enjoyed going into Venice for dinners and a night stroll.   I highly recommend this resort for family or couples, its a lovely retreat!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
