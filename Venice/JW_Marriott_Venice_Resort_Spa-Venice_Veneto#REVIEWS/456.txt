What a treat! From start to finish this getaway was a delight.   We met Bogdan (a summer intern) on our first night dining at Cucina. Top notch pasta and pizza buffet.   Although we were hesitant about the Photoshoot included in the package,it was casual and fun and we were able to capture precious moments to look back on.   Nikolina and Sara helped to plan a beautiful evening complete with tea lights and rose petals all over the place.   We had a private dinner in the kitchen of the Sapori cooking academy since a storm was brewing.  We ate at the most beautiful table made of venetian briccola.   Chef Micki made us dishes that made the taste buds explode with delight while Bogdan kept a discreet watch over us.   Thank you for making this anniversary a trip to treasure.
