We loved this property, staff and hotel. Our experience was fantastic. we were there a few days ago and only stayed for 2 days- wish we stayed longer. It is a little expensive but you pay for what you want!!! Luxury!! From our arrival on a private water taxi to the check in everything was PERFECT. Anna at the check in counter was DELIGHTFUL and so HELPFULL. The staff knew us by our name and greeted us at every corner. Giacomo at room service was very pleasant and quick. We were travelling with our 1 year old baby and he was very prompt when I had to order the milk. The pool was clean, the property was also very clean. The shuttle service was always on time and very helpful people since we had a stroller.   I would stay at this property over and over again!!!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 28, 2017Dear trishabhatt, thanks for your positive feedback.
