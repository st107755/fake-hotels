I can't say enough about the resort. The staff was above and beyond.  Immediately Luca made us feel welcomed and had sparkling wine sent to our room for our anniversary, Gabrielle in the cafe educated us on local foods, made us laugh every morning and made the best cappuccino (sugar did not sink right away) such a delight. While Alessandro's original cocktails in the bar at the roof top pool are perfecto!   We liked being able to get away from the crowds in Venice  to tranquility. The shuttle boat is easy and always on time. Never had an issue or problem.   The room (501) was beautiful. Our own patio to enjoy the quiet mornings or a drink upon return.   We will be back. This is the only place for us to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 6, 2016Dear darsaw20, thanks so much for your review.
