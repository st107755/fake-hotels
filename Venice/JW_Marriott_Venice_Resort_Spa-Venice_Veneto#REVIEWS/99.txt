We have been to Venice twice before and stay close to St Mark square in heritage type of hotel with antique environment. And this time we want to try something different,thats how we pick JW Marriott which is located in a private island.  Located in old buildings but all the interiors are modern,which is what we had wanted. We took a water taxi from the airport,and approaching the resorts private pier is just like in the James Bond movie...... From check in to check out,including staff in the restaurant and room service are very friendly and professional. From the island resort to St Mark,we have to take shuttle boat for around 30 minutes. Although the boat is quite big,we have seen several parties have to wait for the next shuttle which is another half and hour,the trick is youâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
