we loved this hotel due to it being on its own private island, the hotel staff were friendly and the rooms were spacious and clean. the transportation particularly was always on time and the hotel staff were keen to organise taxi services for when the hotel daily transportation services stopped. I would definitely recommend!Read moreDate of stay: April 2019RoomsServiceSleep Quality1 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
