I stayed here using points with my parents for two nights during our trip to Italy.   The hotel and grounds are very beautiful and the service was extremely good.  The water taxi entrance was very nice.   The shuttle service to St. Mark's Square was always convenient, on schedule, and never crowded.  The room was very comfortable and provided a calm, quiet place to relax after a busy day sightseeing.  I would definitely return here the next time I am in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Dec 7, 2016Dear VacationBeachBum, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We appreciate your generous comments about our beautiful grounds and hotel, good customer service, convenient shuttle service and comfortable rooms.  As you mentioned, our property is unique in the sense that it is located on its own private island, which is only a short boat ride away from San Marco Square. Many of our guests tell us that they really enjoy the combination of accessibility to Venice and peace and seclusion that our hotel offers after a full day of sightseeing. Being able to provide this oasis of calm is what makes us special and why many of our guests who are frequent visitors of Venice decide to stay with us time and time again.  Thank you for choosing to stay with us and we hope that we can welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again in the future.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
