They don't tell you how difficult it is to get to the private shuttle. Approximate time from the train station to the actual hotel, 2 hours.   They do recommend that you take a private water taxi for a mere 200 euros each way.  Despite being a gold member and being guaranteed the best rate on the web site, imagine my surprise that I could book the same room for 170 euros less per night.  When I raised this with the receptionist, I was provided a nonsensical response that only irritated me more. I then called Marriott customer service.  They said we had a bad connection and would return my call immediately.  I await the call(40 minutes later) as I write this.  FYI, I never post reviews. However, if I can prevent someone from making my mistake, I will have done something good.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 9, 2016Dear Sandra S, thank you for taking the time to write a review.
