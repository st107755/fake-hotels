This hotel is situated on it's own island, with a free water bus service to and from the main land. The hotel is exceptional, as is the service - the staff just can't do enough for you. The view from the rooftop pool is spectacular, across the whole of venice, and I could have spent the entire day in there, just staring out at the view. The rooms were beautiful too, especially the one with the corner balcony, on which you could have had a party of 20 people!  The food and drinks are very pricey, but then that's what you have to pay in Venice as a whole. If I ever return to Venice, which I sincerely hope I do, I will have to return to this hotel, as no other will compare. Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
