This spa was reccomended to us by some Venetian friends and after a few days of cool rainy weather we decided to go warm up at the Spa with a sauna and treat ourslves to a massage. If you are not a hotel guest you must reserve a 3 hour time slot. The service was impeccable and the facilities were very clean and modern.....I was fantastic sitting in the pool looking at Venice in the distance....We ordered a snack mid visit and it was very delicious ...... Another perk was the free shuttle boat ride, which took us on a tour through a part of the lagoon I had never been to before....Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 13, 2017Dear leonbass, thanks for writing a review.
