Enjoyed a cooking class with chef Micki in the Marriott kitchen. Italian at its best: few good ingredients and lots of flavor. Cooking and eating what you have prepared. Of course with a glass of Italian wine.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 16, 2016Dear renereijnen, thanks for writing a review. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed our cooking class with Chef Micki. Many guests tell us that the culinary classes at our Sapori Cooking Academy are one of the top activities to do when in Venice. It really is a wonderful experience. Guests learn to prepare a whole menu, ranging from the Venetian tradition to the great classics of Italian cuisine. Not only will you enjoy sampling delicious Italian dishes, you will also be provided with the skills and knowledge so you can prepare them at home.   Thank you for choosing to stay at our Isola delle Rose and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
