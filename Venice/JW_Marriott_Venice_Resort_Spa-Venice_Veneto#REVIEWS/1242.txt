We are really grateful for your kind comments about our stunning resort and beautiful views.  I will make sure to share all your generous comments with Carlos and Chef Micky – they will be thrilled to hear that they helped make your experience with us a unique and memorable one.  When Carlos and I were discussing the activities and excursions that we wanted to provide our guests, we thought of all the things that would be part of the ultimate travel experience of Italy.

Thank you for choosing us as your private oasis in Venice and we look forward to seeing you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
