The Hotel is perfect I've been to all the restaurants are excellent, but in the breakfaaaaast the person how is responsible for ordering the staff dont know how to speak to their employees l was with my family and the girl who seems responsible for the staff was upset and stress with one of  waiters and spoke badly in front of customers that is not professional at all. the staff are very friendly and smiling, just the supervisor she must be careful in the way she express in front of customers.... otherwise the rest is very clean, food good and attention of the "waiters" great.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 20, 2016Dear Sebastian B, thank you for your review.
