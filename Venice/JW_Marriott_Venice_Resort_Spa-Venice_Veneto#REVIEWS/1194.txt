Was a really great experience.  The hotel and the island are very great. Boat transfer  to Venice every 30 minutes.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. Roof pool, restaurants and a big park. You also can do a trip by bicycle around the island.

We are delighted that you had a great experience at our Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your kind words about our great location, friendly and helpful staff as well as our nice rooftop pool, restaurants and park.  I am also glad to hear that you were able to enjoy exploring our private island by bicycle. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with loved ones, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
