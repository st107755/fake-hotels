The JW Marriott Resort and Spa is outstanding! A must stay property if you are going to be in Venice! It is a 15-20 min ride by the resort's water taxi to the island but well worth the location outside the noise of the city! Beautiful physical property with lots of room to walk the island and enjoy the view from the roof top restaurant/bar! Great staff! Restaurants on the property! A great property for a romantic getaway as well as family!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 29, 2016Dear pate1949, thanks so much for your positive feedback.
