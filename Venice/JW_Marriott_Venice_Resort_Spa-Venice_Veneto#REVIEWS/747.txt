We are thrilled to hear that you and your family enjoyed your time at our magical Isola delle Rose. We are very grateful for your kind comments about our beautiful hotel, delicious food and genuine and nice staff.  Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our property provides the perfect respite.
