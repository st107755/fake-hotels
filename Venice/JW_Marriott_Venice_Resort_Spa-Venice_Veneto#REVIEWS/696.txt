I can't say enough about this hotel. The design is very modern and clean. The staff are all very well-trained. They are all professional, helpful, and friendly. They all say hello to you in passing. We found the shuttle to be always reliable and on time, and the twenty minutes going back and forth to the hotel was no problem at all. The food at the hotel was very good and the breakfasts outstanding. And since the hotel is on its own island, it's very quiet and removed from the bustle off Venice. The hotel is truly a resort, and it is a destination in itself. This was my fifth visit to Venice and my first stay at this hotel. It is, in my opinion, the best hotel in Venice! Thank you to the staff for a very wonderful and memorable stay!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 30, 2017Dear fffaaazzz, thank you for your glowing review.

Our guests often tell us how they love the opportunity to taste our vegetables grown in our botanic gardens, sample our exclusive olive oil produced from our 100 olive trees or just spend the afternoon in our pools overlooking the dramatic views of Venice and the Lagoon while admiring the incomparable Italian sunset.
