My husband and I just returned from a less than pleasant stay at this resort. We stayed July 17-19 and Venice, like much of Europe, was under extreme heat......which is why we decided to forgo the boutique experience and opt for a new modern chain resort. Air Conditioning!  The first of many issues was the lack of air conditioning in all the public areas as well as in our upgraded residence room.The only place AC was to be found was in the little shuttle boat waiting area. The property was obviously having issues because there was an AC repair person on the boat shuttle every day! There were dozens of people using maps and papers to try and fan themselves all over the place! Everyone looked disgusting! One day we had to sit in our room naked with sweat dripping from every partâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Director of Sales at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 22, 2015Dear Valued Guests,  We really appreciate you taking the time to post a review on our property. Thank you very much for your positive comments on the potential of the property and our staff. We are very proud to manage such a unique resort, first of its kind in Venice and in Europe.  As you rightly mentioned Europe is currently under an unusual and extreme heat and unfortunately lately we are experiencing several problems with the AC that we are fixing. To mitigate the problem we purchased several portable AC units.  We are also working to reduce the time of the check in as we realize that some of our guests prefer to go straight to their rooms instead of receiving an overview on the property activities and facilities.  We are really sorry for the above inconveniences and you can rest assured soon those issues will be fixed.  We really hope you will give us a second chance and you re-visit us soon when we are sure the potential of the resort will be fully expressed.  Cristiano Cabutti Director of Sales & MarketingRead more
