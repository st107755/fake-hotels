Booked this hotel as a spur of the moment last minute trip for 4 of us in july 2015. I can honestly say this is the best hotel i have ever stayed at,  the staff were excellent and the service superb, the hotel is located on its own island and there is a free motor boat that runs every half an hour (i think ) i dont think i could ever afford to go back to this hotel as it was quite expensive to eat and drink here. but hey ho show me anywhere in venice that is not super expensive . But if you get the chance and are  looking for a bit of luxury give this hotel some serious thoughtRead moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Mar 19, 2016Dear tommannix, it means a lot to us to hear you say that our hotel is the best you have ever stayed at. We are grateful for your positive comments about our excellent staff, superb customer service and luxurious resort.  I like the pictures that you included with your review. As you saw, our century-old park is a 16-hectre expanse of greenery â€“ a mixture of old trees and soft lawns, which is impossible to find elsewhere in Venice. I think our historic gardens are one of the most picturesque locations with its scenic 360-degree views of Venice. Last year we hosted a few weddings and some high-profile events at our park and the feedback was amazing. With it being such a large outdoor facility as well as its island heritage, there is no place in Venice like it.  Thank you for choosing Marriott and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
