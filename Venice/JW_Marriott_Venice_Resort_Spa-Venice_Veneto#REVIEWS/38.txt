An amazing hotel beautiful grounds we decided to upgrade to a pool room for an extra â‚¬200 which was not worth it. The pool was smaller than the hot tub.   The hotel is very well maintained and the service was excellent as one would expect from Marriott. The shuttle service is great for getting to the city and runs like clockwork.   Thank you to Claudia, and Jan Marco for all your help.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
