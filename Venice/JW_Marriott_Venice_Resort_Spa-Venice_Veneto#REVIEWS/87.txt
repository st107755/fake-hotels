My wife and I have stayed in Marriotts all over the world. We stay so much the we are near the top of their rewards chart. We are from the states and can only wish that the JW Marriott here in Venice could teach customer service where we are from. I canâ€™t say enough about the following people who have made our stay absolutely over the top amazing: - Beatrice (with a Z) from the roof top restaurant - Docilo from the rooftop restaurant and - Mossimo with the private suite Concierge  THANK YOU!Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
