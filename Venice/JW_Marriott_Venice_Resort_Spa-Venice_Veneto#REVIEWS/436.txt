All the great and not so great of a private island experience. Yes, you have to take a shuttle boat to and from the resort to check-in, out or visit Venezia, but the island itself is extraordinary. Staff is exceptional, particularly at check-in. I was very impressed by both people who I dealt with there. I was given a suite for some reason, which was a very nice room and quite well-appointed. The grounds are great and it would be a wonderful place to escape and wander around on a romantic getaway. It is a 30 minute ferry proposition to go to or come back from Venezia.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 9, 2017Dear Osdanuwati, thanks for taking the time to write a review.
