We are grateful for your generous comments about our excellent staff, exceptional surroundings, good quality food and convenient shuttle service.  We hope you had the chance to explore our private island by bicycle. One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice.

Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
