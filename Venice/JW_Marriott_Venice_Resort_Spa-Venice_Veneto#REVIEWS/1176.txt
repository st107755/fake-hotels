I spent a long weekend at JW Marriott Venice as part of a company convention.  A well designed hotel with a rooftop restaurant/bar which I sampled privately before the event kicked off ... very good prosecco and Caprese salad!  Room was very comfortable.  The transport by private water taxi (20 minutes) to Venice was quick and frequent.  You might take the view that you would prefer to be in the 'centre' but remember the buildings are small. streets narrow and it can be quite noisy.  On a hot summers day the open space and cool breeze in the surroundings of JW Marriott with its good service may well be a more select experience!   Irrespective Venice is a place to visit!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 26, 2016Dear JAMES23272014, thanks so much for your review. We are thrilled that you enjoyed your time at our resort. We appreciate your kind words about our well-designed hotel, comfortable rooms and frequent and quick shuttles to Venice proper. I agree, what we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to Venice means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope you visit us again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
