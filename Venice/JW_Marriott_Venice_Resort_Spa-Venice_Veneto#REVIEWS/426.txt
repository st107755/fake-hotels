The service and attention you receive right at check in is of the luxury sort. I also had a slight cold during my stay and the staff would remember our names and even inquired with my boyfriend when I wasn't around on how I was feeling and if they could provide me with anything. That thoughtfulness was very valued.   We also took advantage of the cooking class there and the chef was a local Venetian that took a 2 hour class and transformed it into something you could actually do at home and replicate plus he sat with us as we ate each pasta dish we made. The class went overtime but it was because it was so informative and we took our time into making our very delicious dishes.   Incredible service, location and beautiful rooftop views of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 24, 2017Dear Chang04, thanks for your review.
