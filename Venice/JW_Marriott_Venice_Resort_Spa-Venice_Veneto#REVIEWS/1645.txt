A business trip, fantastic facilities, customer service and attention to detail is immaculate. Water taxi service is splendid and quite an exhilarating experience. Food, beverages and making sure you are happy is their driving force.   Wi fi even in the bedroom is slow and takes ages to connect. Would definitely recommend for a future stay.
