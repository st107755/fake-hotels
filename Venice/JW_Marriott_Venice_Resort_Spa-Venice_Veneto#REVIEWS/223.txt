Upon arrival were greeted by lovely staff who unloaded our bags namely Ommar and Massimo  We were then shown round by staff (such as a lazy named Mercei) making us feel very welcome  Overall, the facilities and food are very good and the  staff are even better. Such as Giacomo (who is in the spa) who was very helpful and patient with us I strongly recommend this resort for families and couples alikeRead moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
