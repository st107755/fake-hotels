My wife and I just recently enjoyed a three night stay at the JW Marriott.  The setting is magical as the hotel is located on a private island which seems to enjoy it's own microclimate and is well removed from the tourist crowd.  The rooms are very modern and a bit Spartan for our taste.  The quality and variety of the food at breakfast is excellent.  The one thing about this hotel that stands out as exceptional is the quality of the service.  We have never before experienced a hotel staff as attentive and committed to the guest experience.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 22, 2016Dear kenneth e, we appreciate you taking the time to write a review. We are thrilled that you were impressed by our outstanding customer service, dedicated and committed staff and magical setting.  As you mentioned, our private island boosts its own special microclimate, which allows for the flourishing of plants found nowhere else in Venice. Our century-old park and gardens is the home to a variety of vegetables, orchards and even an olive grove with a hundred trees â€“ from which we make our own olive oil for our restaurants.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
