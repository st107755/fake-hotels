My husband booked 3 days at this stunning hotel for my 30th birthday. Stunning hotel Wonderful  grounds and great facilities.  The staff were brilliant  and so friendly.  The roof top pool was beautiful  with stunning views.  The hotel sent a bottle of prosecco to my room to wish me happy birthday. The breakfast  was lovely and you even got as much prosecco as you could manage. My only small complaint  was the extremely  high price for food and drinks Â£14 for a can of coke is crazy. Would  love to go back and stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 8, 2015Dear Gabriella,  Thank you for your kind review; we are delighted to know you experienced our property in occasion of your 30th birthday and that you enjoyed your stay, especially the rooftop area, breakfast, grounds and facilities!
