Set on its own island, twenty minutes from St Marks, the hotel is the most perfect retreat. Elegant, calm and set in beautiful grounds with a sophisticated mix of modern and historic buildings. Most memorable of all is the service. Charming, attentive and genuinely friendly. Nothing is too much trouble and always delivered with true Venetian flair.

We are grateful for your generous comments about our hotel being a perfect retreat, our elegant and beautiful grounds and charming and genuinely friendly customer service.  We also appreciate your lovely feedback about our sophisticated mix of modern and historic buildings. We are so proud of the beautiful design of our 19 buildings on our private island, which are the work of the renowned Italian architect Matteo Thun.
