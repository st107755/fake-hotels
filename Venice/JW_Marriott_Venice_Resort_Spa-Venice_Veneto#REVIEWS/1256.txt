We are thrilled to hear that you had a brilliant stay at our resort. We really appreciate your generous comments about our helpful staff, breathtaking views, amazing food and peaceful location.  What we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to Venice proper means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style. And I agree, it can be certainly tempting to stay on our private island and not leave to go into the city!  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
