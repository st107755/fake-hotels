Whilst the hotel claims to be child friendly it would seem this would only apply during peak season at which point the children’s facilities are very much separated away from the main hotel. With that said, it would seem that the  service and treatment one would expect from a 5* hotel is given to anyone who has Instagram followers or those from the travel industry, so unless you either of these I wouldn’t recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 20194 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Front Office Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 19, 2019Dear Familyholibob,  thank you for your valued review in regards of your recent stay.
