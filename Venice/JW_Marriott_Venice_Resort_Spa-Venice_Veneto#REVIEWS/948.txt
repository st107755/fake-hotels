This is a beautiful hotel located a 20 minute boat ride from Venice on its own private island.  The staff are amazing, friendly and helpful.  The rooms are spacious and beautiful.  There is an excellent roof top restaurant with a small pool (a larger family pool is a short walk from the hotel). There is also a top notch restaurant a short walk from the hotel. Beautiful places to walk around. Shuttle runs about every 30 minutes so no problem getting back and forth.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 24, 2016Dear Kathy D, thanks so much for your review.
