Stayed here for 4 nights and every moment at the JW Marriott was perfect. We quickly had a routine of visiting Dispensa Delicatessen on our way out to the shuttle into the city. The staff here is incredible! Every single person that works there is approachable and always willing to help you make your visit to Venice and unforgettable one. If you can go and find Simone at the Dispensa Delicatessen, he is one of the hidden gems of the island! Always has a new selection of cicchettis or sandwiches to help you get your day started and has great stories and recommendations about the city! We will definitely be staying here anytime we visit Venice in the future.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
