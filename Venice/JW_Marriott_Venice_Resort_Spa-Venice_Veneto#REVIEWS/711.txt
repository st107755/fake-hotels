We stayed two nights at this resort on a month vacation in Europe. The resort grounds were beautiful, the rooms nice and clean. The entire resort provided outstanding service. The bartenders in the Rose Bar went above and beyond during our visit as did the staff for breakfast in the Cucina. We had Nina two mornings in a row and received outstanding service. She was professional and courteous; went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. Marcello was the floor manager and was just as professional. Really everyone in at the resort provided top notch service. The food was good, but the coffee, there are no words. I'll miss Italian coffee when I get home!

We appreciate your generous comments about our nice accommodation, outstanding service, beautiful grounds, nice rooms and good food.  The next time you visit us, I recommend checking out our delicious gelato. We have partnered up with Bologna-based Gelato & Co. Cremeria Italiana, who produce the best gelato in Italy. They use the freshest ingredients in their unique flavors â€“ my all-time favorite is pistachio! We are offering their gelato at our Sagra Rooftop restaurant and we also have a gelato cart by our family pool.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
