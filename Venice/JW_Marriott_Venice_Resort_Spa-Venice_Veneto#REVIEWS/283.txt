From it's unique boat entrance (I call it the James Bond entrance into the lobby), to it's amazing staff and it's fine dining experience, this was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.  Also being on a island, it was a great way to get a way and relax from the city.  The room was awesome, every staff member a joy to be with and I know I will be back.Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
