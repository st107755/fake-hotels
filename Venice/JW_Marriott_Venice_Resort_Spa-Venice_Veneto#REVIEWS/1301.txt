This was our first family visit to La Serenissima, and the location of this hotel on its own island certainly allows for a serene visit to Venice.

We are happy to hear that you and your family enjoyed your time at our beautiful resort. Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, as well as a fantastic Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests. I am delighted that your children enjoyed spending time at our heated rooftop pool with sweeping views of the Venice skyline.  Thank you for choosing the JW Venice and we hope to welcome you and your family back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
