Thank you to GianMarco at reception for an awesome experience at this hotel this week.  Fabulous service, amazing room, beautiful, peaceful island to stroll, swim, relax, only 20 minutes free shuttle to Venice.  All the staff was lovely, kind and helpful.

We appreciate your kind comments about our fabulous service, amazing rooms, beautiful and peaceful island and lovely and kind staff.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as an amazing Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
