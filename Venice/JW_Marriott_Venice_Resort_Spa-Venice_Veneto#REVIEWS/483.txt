This was the second stay at the JW Marriott in Venice and it just keeps on getting better. Again, the staff are extremely friendly and accommodating, the rooms are generously proportioned, clean and have fantastically comfy beds. Just the whole experience being away from the main island of Venice is worth the stay! Two things I’d have to criticize though, are that the breakfast has gone down in quality (it’s still great don’t get me wrong) in terms of choice since it first opened and also that the complimentary JW Marriott water bottles have disappeared, for example in the boathouse. On hot days, they were real life savers…  All in all, I cannot wait until next time!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 5, 2017Dear londontravellerE2, thanks for your review. We appreciate your generous comments about our friendly and accommodating staff and comfy rooms.  We believe having the ability to escape Venice’s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit, our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for your loyalty and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
