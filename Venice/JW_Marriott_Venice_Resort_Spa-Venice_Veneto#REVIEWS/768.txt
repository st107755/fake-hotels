The staff were wonderful and our room was huge. I wasn't expecting a large room because we'd booked our 2-night stay with points but it was beautiful. I will absolutely stay here again when we return to Venice some day :) The restaurant was lovely and the shuttle made it SO easy to travel between the hotel's private island and the main islands of Venice. It is more inconvenient than than staying right in the heart of The Canals but for the peace and quiet of the resort, I don't regret staying here at all.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 10, 2017Dear Ashley O, thanks for your positive feedback. We are grateful for your generous comments about our wonderful staff, big guest rooms, lovely restaurant and convenient shuttle service.  I hope you had the chance to check out our GOCO Spa. It is such a wonderful experience and you can spend a whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
