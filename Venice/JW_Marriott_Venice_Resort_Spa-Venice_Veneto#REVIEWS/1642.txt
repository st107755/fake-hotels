We stayed at this property couple days last week....great hotel, good shuttle service from Piazza San Marcos and the hotel. The only negative thing about this hotel was the breakfast, not good quality buffed and VERY expensive. Better eat breakfast somewhere in the city will be much cheaper and better. 45 euros for person for poor breakfast buffet is not worth it!
