Stayed at the JW over the summer and had a really nice time. The rooms were amazing and the property is pretty gorgeous, even though it's a bit big and a little daunting. Just a few words of caution... the boat ride to and from the main city is a bit tedious in the summer months especially with the bugs. I would think they should get a closed boat and crank the AC because you can be eaten alive in that sweltering heat... and second issue, the restaurant upstairs wasn't great. The pasta left much to be desired and considering the food you can get in Italy, I would think they should work on this. Spa was beautiful and room was awesome. If you don't mind the 20 minute boat ride in the heat or the bugs then you shouldn't have a problem.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Mar 6, 2017Dear TravelDiva1122, thanks for taking the time to write a review.
