The property,grounds and spa are stunning.  make sure you walk around and experience it all. The JW Marriott is the best way to have a very relaxing holiday as well as the Venetian experience.  The rooftop pool is amazing, We went up there each evening for cocktails before dinner, they are superb!. The rooms are spacious and modern and the staff we met were all so polite and courteous. The food is good but the 30 minute shuttle boat in to St Marks Square would be my option each evening for dinner. We asked the hotels concierge for recommendations each evening, he was on the money every time.    We had a great pool party on the Friday night, other than that I don't think there is much nightlife on the island and the hotel bar is very quiet on other evenings.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 10, 2016Dear Steve S, thanks so much for your wonderful review. We really appreciate your feedback on our resort being the best way to have a very relaxing holiday as well as an authentic Venetian experience.  What we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to Venice means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope you visit us again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
