Further to your feedback, we are glad to read that you particularly appreciated our Concierge and Front Desk Team attitude, as well as some highlights of the property, such as the rooftop terrace and the cleanliness of the room. At the same time, we regret that some room features were not perfectly working, such as the shower head. In regards of the transportation, our hotel extends a complimentary shuttle service which runs every thirty minutes, and connects the island to the city center, specifically St. Mark Square. The location represents a perfect retreat to escape from the crowd of Venice, while being only twenty minutes away from the city. Once again, thank you for your genuine review. May you decide to plan a future trip to Venice, do not hesitate to contact us directly.  Kindest regards,  Erica Travan, Front Desk ManagerRead more
