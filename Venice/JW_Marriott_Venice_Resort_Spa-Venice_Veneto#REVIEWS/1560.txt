We stayed here when we visited Venice. The hotel is brand new and everything is fresh and beautiful. The Property seems well maintained. The rooms are big and everything screams comfort. Because it was our anniversary, the hotel staff made sure we got a room with a view of Venice. The hotel staff are friendly and courteous. The only thing that my husband and I found inconvenient was that we had to take their shuttle best to and from their hotel to the city. The problem is that they are not as frequent as we would have liked and their first boat out to St. Marks square was at 9.00 am. . We wanted to take some early morning shots and were very disappointed that did not have boats till 9. Otherwise, we had a great time and would definitely recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
