Perfect hotel to great around to see Venice, even though it is on its own island.  We enjoyed taking the shuttle in and out - takes about 15 min. But it is a pleasant boat ride.  The hotel is large and luxurious, but we stayed in the residenta, which is not attached to the main hotel which we liked a lot.  Staff were extremely efficient.  Grounds still need some work but the facilities were very good.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 31, 2015Dear Jacquelin,  Thanks for your nice feedback!
