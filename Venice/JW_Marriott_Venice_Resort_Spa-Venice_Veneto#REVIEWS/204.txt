Loved this property, our room was spacious with a great view. There are many activities: dining, spa, workout, pool, exploring the property etc. to do. Although my husband and I visited as a couple, I could see having a family gathering and vacation at the resort.  I've been to Venice before and loved being away from the crowds while still having easy accessibility to Venice.  The complimentary boat shuttle to St. Mark's Square was very convenient and prompt every 30 minutes. It was noticed that whenever we passed staff members at the JW Marriott we were greeted very pleasantly. I would stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
