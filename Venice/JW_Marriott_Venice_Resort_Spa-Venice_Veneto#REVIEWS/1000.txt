We had an amazing vacation on this property. The staff was the best we have ever seen in any resort all over the world. Truly happy engaging and interested in making our stay great. We had an experience with Gianmarco in reception who is a fine young man who was disappointed that the restaurant he recommended for meatballs was closed so he had his grandmother Nona make her famous meatballs for us! How amazing is that?! We had a fabulous cooking course with Micki who is a sweet man and incredibly creative chef. The rooftop restaurant was spectacular at sunset made more special by Maria who took great care of us. The spot is world-class and Martina Gibbs the greatest massage ever! Do you think we liked it here?Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 5, 2016Dear AlanBerger239, thank you so much for your review.
