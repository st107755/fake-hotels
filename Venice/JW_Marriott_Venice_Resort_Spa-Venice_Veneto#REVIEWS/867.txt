The term customer service  is obviously  something that still needs to be invented here. I can't believe they charge so much money for a room that actually showed mold stains on the ceiling.

Definitely a place that I do not recommend and will never come back to.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 4, 2016Dear Edwin V, thank you for taking the time to write a review.
