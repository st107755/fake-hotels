This was an amazing stay at a beautiful hotel! It is the most spectacular view in all of Venice and so lovely to have a spacious pool! The staff were especially kind and helpful, especially Emiliano Crespi by the pool who made us feel so welcome and who is an absolute gem to his craft, and also the wonderful team at breakfast, lead by Taekwondo expert Maurizio! He was so kind and accomodating, and his team were amazing! Highly recommend this gorgeous, magical place!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 15, 2015Dear Briony,  Reading your review, we felt so proud and happy of have been part of your travel experience in Venice!
