It all started when we arrived. We, family with two small kids, had to wait for 15 minutes or more to check in. People were jumping the queue, it was a mess. Finally we got our Maisonette room with a small pool. But the door key did not work and the pool was dirty. At a late dinner in the hotel we were finally able to relax. Next day we went to visit Venice. When we came back, the room was not yet made. Somebody showed up only at around 10pm. There were many examples like this. One last: Do you think anybody helped one single time my wive to carry the stroller on the numberous stairs in the hotel? Our summary: This is a hotel at a great location but unfortunately for us the hotel is not properly managed.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Direttore vendite at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 26, 2015Dear Valued Guest, Many thanks for taking the time to share your feedback.
