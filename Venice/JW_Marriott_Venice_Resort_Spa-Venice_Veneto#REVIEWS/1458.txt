We were some of the first travelers to visit the hotel after they opened.  It was stunning.   A gorgeous island, private, calm and elegant with beautiful art in the gardens.   The design was minimal and chic in the rooms with nice touches of Venice like the bw celeb portraits from the 60's.    Quiet, large , clean rooms.   Food great- view ridiculous.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 8, 2015Dear Reggie,  We would like to thank you for your feedback.
