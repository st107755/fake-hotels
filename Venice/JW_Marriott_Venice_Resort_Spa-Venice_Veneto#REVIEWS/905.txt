We appreciate your kind comments about our stunning hotel, lovely grounds, spectacular views from our rooftop pool and excellent customer service.  However, I am sorry to hear that you were disappointed with some aspects of your stay with us. As you mentioned, our resort is unique in the sense that it is located on its own private island, away from the hustle and bustle of Venice. We believe that our secluded and peaceful location is one of our strongest assets as well as our first-class facilities such as our GOCO Spa (the largest in Venice) and our Michelin-starred restaurant, Dopolavoro.  In addition, every decision we made when designing our resort experience and activity program supports our desire to deliver intuitive personal service in an authentic and crafted environment.  We are grateful for your feedback and I am discussing the areas of improvement that you mentioned in your review with the team so that we can further enhance the guest experience. The satisfaction of our guests is our highest priority so I welcome you to contact our Director of Room Operations, Anna Gutova, if you wish to discuss your experience in more detail. You can email her on info.venice@jwmarriotthotels.com.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
