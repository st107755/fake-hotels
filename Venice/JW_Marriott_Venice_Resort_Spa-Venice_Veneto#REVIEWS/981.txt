From our arrival, to what i can only explain as "unique", a boat taxi into the lobby is quite an experience of grandeur. The resort itself is very well staffed with a location that is both peaceful and beautiful in equal measure. The journey to and from the island provided by hotel boat is never the same twice with both the view and the fellow passengers constantly changing. After a long day in the city itself the tranquil setting of the island was great to relax Restaurants and bars were always accommodating and the housekeeping staff could not do more to improve your stay, should you have any requirements. We were un-aware of the church until our visit, so if you are thinking of marrying in such a grand city, i am sure it is a venue to consider.

We appreciate your kind comments about our unique arrival experience, well-staffed resort and our peaceful and beautiful location.  I absolutely agree, I think our private island and luxurious facilities are a perfect venue for special events. Our historic gardens are one of the most picturesque locations with its scenic 360-degree views of the Lagoon â€“ there is no place in Venice like it. Plus our charming church is also the perfect fairytale setting for a wedding.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
