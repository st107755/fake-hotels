We stayed 1 night here in July 2015.  It was perfect and we didn't want to leave.  We got into Venice a day early before we had to start our tour.  I booked this place for 1 night to relax with my friends.   We got to Saint Marco Square where we picked up the boat to take us to this hotel.  It was like being in a movie.  As we got closer to the hotel it was even better.  We were greeted in the lobby by the hotel host and she helped us check in and showed us around.   Breathtaking Fancy Hotel.   I recommend this to anyone who go to Venice.  It was expensive but well worth it.   Next time we go back, I hope to stay longer.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 3, 2016Dear latsaney a, thank you so much for your review. We are delighted that you and your friends enjoyed your short stay at our resort. We appreciate your kind words about our breathtaking and fabulous hotel.  I have noticed that many guests plan a trip to Venice for only two or three nights, but the feedback I have received from all of them afterwards is that they wished they stayed longer. Our guests are pleasantly surprised by the many activities that we have as well as our amazing facilities, such as the GOCO Spa. We always encourage our guests to book a longer stay â€“ at least four or five nights so that they can experience all the wonderful things that we offer.  Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back again soon!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
