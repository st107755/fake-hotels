We are happy that you had a wonderful stay at our resort. We appreciate your kind comments about our stunning property, convenient shuttle service and excellent staff.

Our proximity to Venice means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city – but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope you visit us again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
