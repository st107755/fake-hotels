We had a great time there! Love the reception 1-1 service with sitting area,the good quality food,friendly and helpful staff,the view over the lagoon,the design of the room and the hall,the water bus(run till late 1am,good for night out)! A recently opened 5*hotel, with easy access to st Marco, own pier for the water taxi which is easy to find(near the royal garden). Two things I would like to mention: The pool is very small after half of it used for Jacuzzi ,it is not so deep-just above my waist when I stand up but the view is great! The shower is fixed in a way water can easily leaked out After a shower, lots of water ended on the floor,it is not a big problem but could be better! Anyway,we were  happy with our stay!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 8, 2015Dear Wendy,  Thank you for taking the time to write of your experience at our property.
