We are delighted that you enjoyed celebrating your 40th birthday with your family at our Isola delle Rose. We are grateful for your kind words about our modern and spacious guestrooms, friendly staff and beautiful spa.  Did your daughter have the chance to check out the Kids Club during your stay? When the team and I were brainstorming the activities for the Kids Club programme, we wanted to offer something that would incorporate aspects of Italian culture so that the children would get to know the history and traditions of our beautiful country. Some of the activities that we are proud to offer families include Italian language lessons, creating and painting your own mini gondola and making Venetian masks. We hope your daughter was able to enjoy the many fun activities that we have, as well as our new Adventure Park and playground located next to the Family Pool.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
