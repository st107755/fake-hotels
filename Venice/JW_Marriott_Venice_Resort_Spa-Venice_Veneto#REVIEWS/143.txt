Stayed here 22nd-24th March, this hotel is absolutely breathtaking, we paid extra and got a private taxi boat to and from the hotel and truly felt like James  bond, upon arrival the staff where extremely professional and friendly. We ate in the restaurant on roof terrace on Saturday night, the food was exceptional and staff very friendly. This hotel is a diamond, itâ€™s quiet and peaceful and breathtaking for its views of Venice. Highly recommended, thank you for making our birthday weekend so memorable .Read moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare
