Fabulous hotel, attentive and non intrusive staff.  No complaints at all.  Would definitely return. The roof top pool is amazing. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Only one criticism it needs a shelf or basket in the shower to hold shampoo etc. Stupid comment but damn annoying when having a shower.  Loved the hotel.
