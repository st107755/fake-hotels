We have just returned from this hotel with our two children (ages 11 and 8).  Venice itself is totally beautiful and full of charm.  We stayed at the JW Marriott for three nights and it was totally amazing.  The hotel is gorgeous and the staff were so helpful, polite and cheerful.  Can't recommend this hotel enough :) Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 7, 2016Dear 673becky, thanks so much for your review. We really appreciate your generous comments about our amazing resort, gorgeous hotel and helpful and polite staff.  When the team and I were brainstorming the activities for the Kids Club programme, we wanted to offer something that would incorporate aspects of Italian culture so that the children would get to know the history and traditions of our beautiful country. Some of the activities that we are proud to offer families include Italian language lessons, creating and painting your own mini gondola and making Venetian masks. We hope your children were able to enjoy the many fun activities that we provide, as well as our new Adventure Park and playground located next to the Family Pool.  Thank you for recommending us and we hope to see you and your family again soon!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
