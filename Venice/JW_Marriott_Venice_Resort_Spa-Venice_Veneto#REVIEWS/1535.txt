Will be a great hotel but its a bit soulless at the moment, drinks are expensive even by Venice standards and the air con as previous reviewers have stated is poor. Excellent rooms ( we were upgraded to a Junior Suite) with good breakfast selection. Shuttle service to Venice ran on time with a service to Piazza Roma at 6,7 and 8am. From here just 6 euros each on the airport bus which took about 30 minutes.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
