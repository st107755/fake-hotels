From the approach to the amazing water entrance  to the fabulous staff, this is the best place to stay in Venice. It has its own cathedral on its private island, a 5 star renowned restaurant, roof top restaurant with fabulous views of Venice and employees that are beyond any expectation.  Everyone is beyond friendly but in a genuine way.  I can't say enough good things about this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 20, 2017Dear smartstayer, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We are grateful for your generous comments about our amazing arrival experience, fabulous staff and beautiful facilities.  We hope you had the chance to check out some of the activities and excursions that we offer at our resort such as our Sapori Cooking Academy, which is a big hit with our guests. The morning program we offer is such an unforgettable experience. The day starts off with meeting our Chef and travelling together via private water taxi to the colorful Rialto Market. He helps you choose the freshest ingredients to take back to the resort where he teaches how to prepare delicious dishes following the Venetian culinary tradition. Plus, you get to enjoy the lunch that you helped prepare. It is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the local culture â€“ I highly recommend it.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
