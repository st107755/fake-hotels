Overall the place is lovely and worth a stay, rooms are spacious and refurbished and modern. Staff are very helpful. I was there for a business conference and this was well managed only issue meeting rooms are not well equipped ie projectors  Some of the places you have to be careful as you can slip , it was extremely wet. The pizza is great and they have a culinary school as well.  Beware when the weather is rough you canâ€™t get of this island to go to main Venice, so you could get secluded!
