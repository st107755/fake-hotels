Stayed here in April with the family we upgraded to a room with a plunge pool which was a two story suite with the dopolavoro restaurant across the canal . The whole place is lovely great attentive service fantastic gym rooftop pool kids pool and fantastic spa . We found the boat service fantastic every half hour there is a boat so you can go into town and back whenever you want . The beauty about this place is that you are in a holiday resort one minute and the buzz and beauty of Venice the next . What also made the place was Micky the chef and his stunning cooking school it's a must do and great experience .Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 3, 2016Dear Martino B, thank you for your review. We are grateful for your positive comments about our attentive customer service, lovely facilities and fantastic boat service to and from the hotel.  I agree, I think one of the main benefits of staying on your own private island is the peaceful retreat our resort provides after a busy day in Venice. Venice is certainly an exciting and thrilling destination, with its vibrant culture and rich history as well as the hustle and bustle of its crowded streets but many of our guests tell us that they like being able to come back to our relaxing hotel after a full day on the main island. We are glad that you felt that way too!  Thank you for choosing to stay at our Isola delle Rose and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
