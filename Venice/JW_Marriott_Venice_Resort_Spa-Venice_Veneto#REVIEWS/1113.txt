We stayed 4 nights at this fabulous Hotel.  A jewel in Venice!  The staff were brilliant and couldn't be more attentive and helpful.  I have to also pay special attention to Mark one of the resorts managers. There was a minor issue we had which was quickly dealt with professionally and courteously.  The issue doesn't warrant a mention!  Will certainly revisit.  Well done JW Marriott for another success story in your hotel portfolio.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 15, 2016Dear CornishfanAylesbury, thank you so much for your review.
