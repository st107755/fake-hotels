We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful and well-appointed accommodations, excellent customer service and frequent shuttle service.  As you experienced, what we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to Venice means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we look forward to welcoming you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
