It was nice being on the island. It felt very exclusive, however when you pay $18 for a mock mojito I almost had a mini heart attack. Everything was way beyond expensive. It was just ridiculous. French fries for $10 is unheard of. The great this is that the service is impeccable. Everyone greets you with a smile. The best part of our trip was the private cooking class with Luigi. He was perfect! We made a three course meal. It was delicious. We wished we could pack him into our suitcase and bring him home with us. The food we prepared was great skills that we could make at home. We would highly recommend taking a cooking class. The experience was worth it.Read moreDate of stay: August 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
