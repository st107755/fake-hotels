This trip taught me that Marriott is fine for business, not good experience for vacation.  if you visit visit for pleasure, stay in Venice.   1.  Room was not as requested. My 'garden view' was of weeds and overgrown grass.  2. No privacy since the walkway ran behind our 'private patio' 3. Actually argued  with me that it was a good room after they asked what I thought about the room and gave them my opinion. 4.  They just opened in May, maybe they rushed the opening.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 9, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor.
