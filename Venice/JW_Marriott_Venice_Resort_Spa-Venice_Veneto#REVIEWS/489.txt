Property is beautiful and staff are fantastic.  It's a little remote and there was no acknowledgement for being a platinum member and no upgrade offered.  I would recommend the property if you want to spend a lot of time at the resort; however, it is very inconvenient to the city, a 25 minute boat ride in each direction.  If you are there to see the sights you may want to stay at a hotel in Venice vs. the island.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 2, 2017Dear Jon P, thanks for your review.
