This is a great hotel designed with relaxation in mind.  There is something for everyone at the hotel, as we had 3 teenagers and 3 adults on the trip.  If the kids were younger, there would have been a Kids Club for them to attend.  The hotel is situated on a private island, which guests can explore at their leisure on foot or bicycle.

We appreciate your kind comments about our great hotel, excellent amenities and relaxing environment.  It sounds like you and your family were able to enjoy our lush grounds. Our century-old park is a 16-hectare expanse of greenery – a mixture of old trees and soft lawns, which is impossible to find elsewhere in Venice.
