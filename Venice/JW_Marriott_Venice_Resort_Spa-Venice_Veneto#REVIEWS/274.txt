If you arrive (leave) via train in the morning up to 11am there does seem to be a direct hotel run  taxi, but there is some confusion about it.  The hotel run taxi to/from St Mark's square is every 30-minutes and is very effecient way to get back and forth and takes approx 25 mins on average,  When we arrived, l ike many (who discussed this topic on the taxi) we had lunch outside at the roof top pool but much to our disappointment we were charged an $8 per head cover charge (up from $3 last year we heard).  While the view was great this was disappointing, especially as we were on an island with no non-hotel run options and the food was ok.  The hotel had two conferences while we were there and if you want to charge those on expense accounts $8 a head to just SIT at your tableâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
