The hotel was fine but at the Sagra Rooftop Restaurant they repeatively overcharged us. Everything from charging €12 for a kids juice (saying they miscoded it as a cocktail), to a (keying error) for an extra bottle of €7 still water, to €7 per person for a 'cover charge' on Sunday night. They fixed each one after being asked. They must be paying some game to boost sales. Nice place, but watch your pocketbook.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 2, 2016Dear David H, thanks for you review.
