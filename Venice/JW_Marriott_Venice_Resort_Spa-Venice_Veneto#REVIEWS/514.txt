Let me start by saying, I didn't not stay at this hotel, I toured the property and ate at one of the restaurants. I toured it for when I bring back a big group - I was there about three hours. JW bought the island about 3 years ago - it's rather impressive!  It's AMAZING if you want exclusivity with access to the main touristy areas of Venice (a 30 minute free shuttle boat ride from San Marco Plaza)  The rooms are bright, spacious and nice closets and I loved them, spa was top notch, the staff was consistent with service. The food was great and I love the wine. It didn't feel American, it felt authentic.   I loved that they have family pools and then the adult roof top pool with the most amazing view.   I loved the tour and am planning to go back!Read moreDate of stay: August 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 23, 2017Dear epicaprille, thanks for your glowing feedback.
