The property located on the Island of the Rose, off main Venice is a haven of peace and quietude away from the thronging crowds of San Marco. It is a serene cocoon connected by a very punctual and efficient complimentary water shuttle that transports you either way every half an hour. A sprawling resort with every conceivable facility to charm, especially the warm and genuine smiling faces of the hotel staff. A marvellous buffet breakfast spread with changing menu to suit every palate, you could even forget the lure of Venice after a hugely satisfying breakfast! The only sore point was that the water shuttle starts only at 9 am and we had to change hotels or pay a steep charge for a private shuttle in order to catch the early morning flight.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 4, 2016Dear Amrita_12_11, thanks so much for your feedback. We appreciate all your generous comments about our peaceful retreat, warm and genuine staff and marvelous breakfast buffet.  Did you have the chance to explore our private island by bicycle? One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our historical gardens. It really is a fun and memorable way to enjoy our Isola delle Rose.  We also appreciate you sharing your comments about the start time of our shuttle. The team and I are discussing what can be done to resolve this issue. Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
