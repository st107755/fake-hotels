The JW Marriott Resort and Spa in Venice, Italy gives you the best of both worlds private island getaway, coupled with the old world charms of Venice, Italy. The resort is fabulous, especially for families. There are so many activities, pool, splash pad, basketball, archery, and much more. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and quiet. Also the hotel provides water taxi service which is very convenient to use all throughout the day. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. My family will definitely be staying at the JW Marriott in Venice again, and would recommend it to anyone traveling there. Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
