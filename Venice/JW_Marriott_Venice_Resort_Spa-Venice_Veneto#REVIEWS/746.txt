My wife and I used Marriott Reward Points to spend 7 days and 6 nights at this marvelous resort. We stayed in one of the little villas away from the main building, which were spacious and modern. The continental breakfast was the best one I've ever seen. Nina, our morning waitress on 3 of our five breakfasts, was outstanding. We only ate at Sagra Restaurant once and the food was fabulous. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Wish we could have stayed longer. Hopefully one day we can go back for another visit.
