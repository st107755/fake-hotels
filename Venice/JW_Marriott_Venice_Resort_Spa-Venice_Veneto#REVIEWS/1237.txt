Stayed at the JW Marriott for 5 days. It is a amazing hotel with outstanding service but we did feel that the cost of food and drink in the hotel was very high and it was cheaper to eat over in venice. The swimming pools were lovely and heated with views over the water to venice. An amazing experience in a very nice hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 25, 2016Dear hcmctc, thanks so much for your review. We are delighted that you had an amazing experience at our resort. We are grateful for your kind words about our nice hotel, outstanding customer service and beautiful views.  Did you have the chance to explore our private island by bicycle? One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent bikes (complimentary and included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our historical gardens. It really is a fun and memorable way to enjoy our Isola delle Rose.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
