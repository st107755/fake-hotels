I have just returned from a two day stay here, I was in Venice for an award ceremony so this was perfect to relax and spend my time before and after the event. The hotel is a true 5 star with every facility and great service throughout. The restaurant on the roof is superb and breakfast was great( 29 Euros for a buffet) but not included in the room rate. I used the spa twice and enjoyed the massages and wellness offerings again with excellent service. The boat that takes you across to Venice is charming and frequent and even if you were in this amazing city for sightseeing would not be a problem, Overall a great expereince, would go back for sure.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 19, 2016Dear jason b, thanks so much for your review.
