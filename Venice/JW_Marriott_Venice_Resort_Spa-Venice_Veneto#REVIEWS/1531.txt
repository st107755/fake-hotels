We stayed in this wonderful resort last week and had an absolutely divine time!  Our room was perfect, the service staff amazing, and a beautiful view of all of Venice from the rooftop pool.  Our air conditioning was superb and our room was large, private balcony, two vanities and separate tub and shower in the bath.   I would like to thank Marco at the Concierge's desk for being so helpful regarding our unfortunate experience of lost luggage for most of our time there.  He was constantly checking on it and following up with us.  His professionalism was stupendous and even helped us with a cell phone issue.  Please give him our many thanks!   We want to return to Venice just to stay here again!   Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
