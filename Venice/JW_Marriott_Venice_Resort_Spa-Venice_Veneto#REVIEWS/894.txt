We just checked out this morning, and we miss the resort ALREADY. This hotel is one of the nicest JW Marriott's, we've ever stayed in! The boat shuttle to St. Marks, runs every 30 minutes from 8:00AM - midnight. The boat was on time during our four night stay. While trying do find a negative about our stay, the only one we can find, is that we didn't stay for our 5th night. We decided to stay at another Marriott our last night, and this was a MISTAKE! We're looking forward to staying at this JW on our next trip to Venice!!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 19, 2016Dear Anthony H, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate your generous comments about our nice resort and convenient shuttle service.  We are thrilled that you enjoyed your time at our magical Isola delle Rose. Hopefully when you visit us again for a longer stay you will have the chance to check out our GOCO Spa. It is such a wonderful experience and you can spend a whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
