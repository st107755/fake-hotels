We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful, peaceful and relaxing resort. We are thrilled to hear you say that our magical Isola delle Rose is the best place to stay in Venice!  We hope the next time you visit us you have the chance to check out our Sapori Cooking Academy. The morning program we offer is such an unforgettable experience. The day starts off with meeting Chef Micki and travelling together via private water taxi to the colorful Rialto Market. He helps you choose the freshest ingredients to take back to the resort where he teaches how to prepare delicious dishes following the Venetian culinary tradition. Plus you get to enjoy the lunch that you helped prepare. It is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the local culture – I highly recommend it.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we look forward to welcoming you back again soon – this time for a longer stay!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
