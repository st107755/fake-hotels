I've been to Venice at least 25 times; I teach there, I research there and, over the years, I've fallen completely in love with the city.  I usually rent a flat somewhere off the tourist track and it's glorious.  But, sometimes, you want to see a place you love in a new way, and that's what the Marriott Resort gives you - a fresh perspective on one of the world's most beautiful cities.  The resort occupies the entirety of the Isola delle Rose, which is about 20 minutes out from Piazza San Marco by speedboat across the lagoon.  The island is green and treed and deliciously peaceful, and the hotel itself occupies some buildings originally built to house a spa and hospital in the 19th century.  The Marriott has reinterpreted this recuperative mission in an enitrely luxurious way. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
