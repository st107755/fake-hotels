Our visit to the JW Marriott Resort & Spa was nothing less than amazing. From the moment you step off the boat on their private island, the magic begins. The property is beautiful, the rooms gorgeous and the service is 5-Star+!  The Sagra Restaurant is deck-side with a spectacular view of the city. The food was incredible and the service by the Manager, Beatrice and Carlo, our waiter was so good we cancelled dinner in town the next night so we could experience the magic again!  JW Marriott and Sagra are now our TOP picks for an amazing experience!Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
