This is a lovely hotel.  Staff are friendly, smiley and extremely helpful.  We had a gorgeous suite, which was kept spotlessly clean.  Large bathroom, comfortable seating, large dressing room, excellent air con.  Breakfasts are very good.  There are two pools; the one on the roof has stunning views.  Courtesy boats to St. Mark's Square run constantly.  I would suggest getting a water taxi from the airport direct to the hotel - 130 euros but well worth it.  It is fabulous to spend the day, or most of the day, around the pool, and then go across to Venice late afternoon or early evening.  You get the best of both worlds staying here, and I would recommend it!  This was not our first visit, and I certainly hope it won't be our last.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
