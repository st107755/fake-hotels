the room the t i stayed in was up to standard and made me feel warm when i entered it. the roof top bar was a highlight as you got an amazing view over the whole of venice. the service was impeccable no matter where you were in the hotel from the bar to the restaurants. the most immersive thing for me though was the handing out of umbrellas when it started to rain this sums up the amount of thought that is constantly happening around the resort.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 12, 2016Dear rupertbutcher19, thanks so much for your review.
