We are delighted that you had an excellent stay at our magical Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your kind comments about our friendly staff, nice rooms, excellent breakfast, nice facilities and splendid views from our rooftop pool.  I agree, our Sagra Rooftop restaurant and bar offers one of the best vantage points to admire breathtaking 360-degree views of Venice and the Lagoon. It is also the ideal place to watch the beautiful Venetian sunset. Many guests tell us how much they enjoy spending Happy Hour there while indulging in a glass of prosecco and some tapas from our Cicchetti Menu. It is an experience not to be missed.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
