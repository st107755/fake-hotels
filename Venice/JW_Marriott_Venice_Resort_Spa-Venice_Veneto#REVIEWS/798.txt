From the free shuttle service to being guided to your room in a golf buggy and amazing food there is nothing I can fault this place for. The hotel staff are amazing and so friendly, polite and helpful. Alessandro and Alessandra helped us over thre three days we were here. We flew out on my birthday and got a complimentary upgrade which we weren't expecting and also at the restaurant on the fourth floor that evening I was surprised with a special made tiramisu and candles with the staff singing happy birthday to me. It was very special. The breakfast in the morning is amazing and the staff can't assist you more. We would love to go back in summer and take advantage of the roof top pool views! Thank you for a magical stay.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 10, 2016Dear KellyDoug, thanks for your wonderful feedback.
