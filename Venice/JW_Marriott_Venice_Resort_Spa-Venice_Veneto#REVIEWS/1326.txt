This is a true 5 star hotel.  We stayed here on both ends of our cruise and it was excellent. From check in we stayed once in the ulivetto building and the second in a Jr suite in the main building. This was the best sleep we had in 3 weeks, beds were unbelievably comfortable. The grounds were also stunning. The only drawback is it I s on its own island so the food and drinks are outrageous. 26 euro for a burger and 18 euro for a jack and coke are a little bit ridiculous.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
