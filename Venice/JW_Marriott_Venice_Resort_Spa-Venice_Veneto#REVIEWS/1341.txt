An amazing location with impeccable service and highly professional and friendly staff. Stayed in an Ulivetto room which was large and had an excellent veranda. Breakfast is plentiful and the boat service is regular. Island location allows you to dip in and out of Venice at leisure yet have a refuge from the crowds. Spa is also very good. I've stayed in Venice a few times and this is the best hotel I've stayed at. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
