Venice is an exciting and historical place to visit, but the crowds and hustle and bustle can often be overwhelming. This new JW Marriott resort occupies an entire island and is worlds away from the main tourist areas, but close enough for them to be easily accessible by boat. Having been to Venice several times before, we were delighted to spend a couple of night at this hotel. Being new, all of the facilities are fresh and clean, as are the rooms. There are dining options to suit everyone, from the Cuchina family restaurant to a one star Michelin restaurant. We were there in August and found the number of children in Cuchina to be a bit overwhelming, so stayed with the other dining choices. The food quality was good and, where the buffet was concerned, was regularly restocked.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 12, 2016Dear acar42, thanks for your positive review. We are grateful for your generous comments about our fresh and clean facilities, plentiful dining options, good quality food, fun activities and friendly staff.  I agree, I think one of the main benefits of staying on your own private island is the oasis of calm that our resort provides after a busy day in Venice. Venice is certainly an exciting and thrilling destination, with its vibrant culture and rich history as well as the hustle and bustle of its crowded streets but many of our guests tell us that they love being able to come back to our relaxing hotel after a full day on the main island.   Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you and your family back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
