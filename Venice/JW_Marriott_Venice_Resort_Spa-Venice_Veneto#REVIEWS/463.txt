This hotel is fantastic. Beautiful property and the people are all so great and friendly.   THE POOL. Even if you don't want to swim you need to sit by it.  The complementary shuttle to St Marco Square is easy and very punctual.  The breakfast spread was SO GOOD.  Nina and Danilo made sure our coffee and prosecco  never ran out!!  And I know I already said it but every is so friendly. Great atmosphere.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 16, 2017Dear Josh M, thanks for your positive feedback. We appreciate your generous comments about our awesome hotel, beautiful property, friendly staff, delicious breakfast and great atmosphere.  You might be interested to hear that besides the regular menu at our rooftop restaurant Sagra, we also offer a special menu from the Cicchetti Bar, which are Venetian-style tapas. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden.

Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
