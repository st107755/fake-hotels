This new hotel is swanky, modern and stylish. Everything is clean and the landscape is well manicured and beautiful. Rooms are spacious, staff are well trained and they have lots of activities in the resort to keep u busy. It is a nice place to stay outside the touristy main area of Venice. They do however provide shuttle to the San Marco square so you can visit the city without a hasle. Excellent!!

We are absolutely thrilled to hear you say that we are the best resort in Venice. We appreciate your kind comments about our modern and stylish hotel, beautiful landscape, spacious rooms, well-trained staff and fun activities.  I hope you had the chance to take part in on our Olive Oil Tasting tour during your stay with us. We love explaining to our guests the history of our 100 olive trees and how they grow. We also showcase different olive oils, including our own which is the only one produced in Venice and exclusively served at our Dopolavoro Dining Room.   Thank you for choosing to stay our Isola delle Rose and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
