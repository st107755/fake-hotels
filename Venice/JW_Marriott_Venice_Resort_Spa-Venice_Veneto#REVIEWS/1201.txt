I used to like bueax arts hotel the most (Marriott property) After few years, Ritz Carlton Hong Kong was the best. Now, JW Marriott Venice is definitely the best out of the best. It has their own island and lots of dedicated resources and man power to preserve everything here and willing to do a good job and make things right.  I stayed here just yesterday. It's like a dream and was treating us good in our honeymoon. Love the decoration here, love the things here, love the shuttle here, love the room here, and love the consideration they had for us.  There is no reason to not fall in love with this hotel. Thank you for making our honeymoon good.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
