Stayed here 3 nights with my husband. I had read on the Marriott website about this new luxury 5* spa hotel - great I thought. When I emailed the hotel to ask how I go about booking treatments a week before we were due to arrive I was told that the spa was not finished and construction had overrun. I honestly don't think they were going to tell us unless I asked. When we got there the location and grounds are beautiful - the suite we had was clean and nicely decorated - the bath way tiny!  The coffee machine didn't work and it was only on our last day they managed to fix it. The milk and tea never got replaced. The housekeeping didn't turn down 2 of the nights we were there, the final night they did arrive at 9.30pm ???? Really??? Staff were friendly enough if you approachedâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 3, 2015Dear Sir,  We would like to thank you for sharing your thoughts with us; we are sorry to read you experienced some issue during your stay. Although we have been experiencing some technical issues with the newly opened hotel, unfortunately this does happen in the opening and we can see daily improvements.  The Spa is now open as well as the family pool and Dopolavoro Dining Room; regarding shuttle service, we offer a complimentary shuttle to Piazzale Roma early in the morning (departing from our island at 6.00a.m., 7.00a.m., 8.00a.m.) so it is ideal for people who need to reach the airport or the rail station in the early hours of the day. Our suggestion, however, is to take a private water taxi straight to the airport: it is a little bit expensive but it takes only 40 minutes (while the combination of our complimentary shuttle service and public transportation to the airport could take you over 1h15/1h30).  We thank you again and remain with our sincerest regards,  Linda Bertoni Marketing & Communication ManagerRead more
