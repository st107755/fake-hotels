Thoroughly enjoyed staying here. Marvelous resort with good shuttle service into Venice proper.  The crowds were so thick, it was a joy to return to the peace and tranquility found here.  Enjoyed strolling the island as well.  At first I thought I would miss being "close to the action" but found it a quiet respite.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 31, 2016Dear gincy, thanks so much for your review. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your time at our magical Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your kind feedback about our marvellous resort, good shuttle service and peaceful atmosphere.  What we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to San Marco Square means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
