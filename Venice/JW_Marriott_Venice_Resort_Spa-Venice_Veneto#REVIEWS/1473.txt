Will be a 5 star when they work out the bugs. Too many little things wrong without the management to solve any of them. Cool place but be sure you know what you're getting into by staying on a separate island. Shuttle is good but sometimes crowded. Not practical to take shuttle for checkin. This is the time for a taxi ride, maybe pay the driver extra to take the grand canal if starting from the train or bus.

We would like to apologize if we have not been able to fully meet your expectations; should you wish to better express your doubts, please feel free to send us an e-mail with your details - full name and dates of stay - so we can better understand your concerns. This will help us also to improve our service and dedication to our Guests.  Regarding our complimentary shuttle service, sometimes it could be crowded depending on the occupancy, but we offer a regular schedule, and in some periods of the day it runs every 15 minutes. This service is a really unique experience: you cross the smooth lagoon in total comfort as ours are luxury boats and we provide onboard complimentary bottled water and free WiFi, and you get off directly in front of the Royal Gardens, just few steps from St. Markâ€™s Square.  We hope to have the chance in the future to welcome you back to Venice and to our Isola delle Rose.  We thank you again and remain with our sincerest regards,  Linda Bertoni Marketing & Communication ManagerRead more
