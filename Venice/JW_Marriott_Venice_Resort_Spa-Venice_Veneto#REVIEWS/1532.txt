normally stay in central venice when I visit, but tried the island based Marriott on my last trip and wasn't disappointed. The room was modern and vast - so much room and lots of light. We didn't spend too much time in the room or the hotel - apart from a delicious lunch at the top of the hotel - before we left in the complimentary shuttle boat to venice. My brother visited the gym and there is also a spa. There is a great bar downstairs adjacent to the main lobby and we enjoyed a drink there. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend it especially if you like to escape from the hustle and bustle after a day of exploring Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
