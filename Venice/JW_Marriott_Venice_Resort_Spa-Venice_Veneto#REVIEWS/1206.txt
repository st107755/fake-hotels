We appreciate your kind comments about our gorgeous property and nice staff.   I sympathize with your comments about public transportation in Venice – it can be hectic at the best of times! We always encourage guests to take our private shuttle to and from the airport and our resort. It might cost more but it is definitely the less stressful and more pleasant arrival experience.  As you mentioned, our restaurants and spa get booked well in advance so we always encourage guests to make reservations beforehand. You can do this easily by emailing info.venice@jwmarriotthotels.com. Our aim is to help our guests have an unforgettable holiday so one of the best ways we can do this is by corresponding with our guests before their arrival so we can learn more about what they want from their vacation experience with us.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
