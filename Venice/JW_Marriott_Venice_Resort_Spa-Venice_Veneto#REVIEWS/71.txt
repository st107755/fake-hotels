This is the second time we've stayed at this JW.  We enjoyed our stay more this time as it was a little warmer and we were able to use the roof top pool.  The pool area is fabulous.  We had 2 nice suites.  The staff is super accommodating and brunch was fantastic.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
