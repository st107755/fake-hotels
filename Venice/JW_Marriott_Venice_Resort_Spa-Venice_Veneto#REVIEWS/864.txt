We stayed at the JW after a horrible first night at the Grimaldi apartments. We found the JW the perfect location for Venice which is off the main over crowded island and finding our little oasis for some down time. The pool and recreational facilities are great for kids and families.

We appreciate your kind words about our perfect location and great family-friendly facilities.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very kids-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as an amazing Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
