We apologize for the delay in delivering your luggage; being part of a cruise ship group, we received over 400 pieces of luggage all together and some of them were missing guests’ name tags, making the delivery difficult for us.  We are aware that this cannot be a justification but please be assured that this is not our usual routine; kindly consider what happened an unlucky circumstance.  Referring to our facilities dedicated to disabled people, please note that – as per Italian law – we provide guestrooms with dedicated bathroom, public bathrooms and specific flight of stairs to be used by wheelchairs.  We are improving day by day our facilities and we would like to thank you for your comments, as feedbacks allow us to understand our areas of improvement.  We hope to have the chance to welcome you back in the future, and demonstrate that what you kindly pointed out was a combination of negative circumstances, and not our usual routine.  Sincerest regards,  The ManagementRead more
