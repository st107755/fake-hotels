The hotel lived up to all my expectations. Was there for only 4 nights and enjoyed my stay immensely. Even though the deluxe room was not quite what I expected, the hotel staff were quick to respond and did their utmost to make our stay a happy one. Of particular note was the consistent, friendly and obliging service from ALL members the hotel team. Fantastic! Customer service always makes all the difference when you are on holiday regardless of setting or location.   Set in a fabulous location on it's own island, it was a wonderful place to retreat to after a hectic day in Venice. The surroundings were luxurious and even thought it's a large place, it manages to maintain a certain serenity. Will certainly consider visiting again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 28, 2017Dear Lyndaedu, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We are grateful for your generous comments about our consistent and friendly staff, fabulous location and luxurious surroundings.  We believe having the ability to escape Veniceâ€™s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit, our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
