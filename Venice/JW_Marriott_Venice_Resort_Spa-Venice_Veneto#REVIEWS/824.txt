Everything about this place is fantastic, I cannot recommend highly enough.  Without exception the staff are friendly and helpful. The breakfast is excellent as were the 2 evening meals we had in the roof top restaurant. The bar serves delicious cocktails, especially Vincienzo ,created by one of the bar staff. The grounds are a delight and getting to and from Venice couldn't be easier, the launch ran every half an hour.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 28, 2016Dear fortonbear, thank you so much for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our friendly and helpful staff, delicious food and cocktails and delightful grounds.  I am also happy to hear that you enjoyed the boat journeys to and from the resort into Venice proper. We have been told by many of our guests that the approach into San Marcoâ€™s Square is spectacular. It is such a dramatic sight that there have been a few times when the Captain has had to ask our guests on the boat to remain seated as they got closer to the Square because many of them were inspired to stand up and take pictures.

All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager  Read more
