As all the reviews below attest, this property is a must do if you're visiting Venice   We arrived at Venice airport and took a private water taxi (120euros an worth every penny) across the lagoon, pulling into the James Bond style entrance to this hotel. Check in was super friendly and efficient and we relaxed into our fresh modern room and began to explore. The serenity of having your own island cannot be underestimated. Central Venice can be hot and madly busy, yet here you got to escape and relax, having all our needs expertly met by the staff. Yes the location is amazing, but best of all are the staff who really put themselves out to make your stay perfect. thank you!

We really appreciate all your feedback about us providing the ultimate resort experience – it is music to our ears to hear you say that we are a perfect island retreat!  I agree that having the ability to escape Venice’s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit. I think our private island is an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
