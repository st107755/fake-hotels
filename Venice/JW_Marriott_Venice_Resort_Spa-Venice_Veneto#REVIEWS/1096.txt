The hotel is located on an island. They provide a complimentary shuttle to and from St Mark Square which takes about 30 minutes. If you spend some time in Venice, but don't want the noise and ...crowds, this is a great place. Quiet, great location, friendly staff, good service, etc. Pricy, yes, but then, what is not pricy in Venice. The location alone is worth it. Rooms are nice and well appointed.
