First of all we have just arrived and do tell you to please take the water taxi here!! Wish someone would have said this earlier. We were a big group (10) and lost money waiting on Vaporette (Water Bus) and the lines were ridiculous. I mean it was BAD with pushing and shoving. We came in from the train station and found the Vaporette outside 7.5 euros one way and didn’t realize how ridiculous the lines would be. Enough of that!  This place is spectacular with a pool area, one for adults and great rooms and ambiance. Yes it’s expensive and know that before that so it doesn’t shock you. We just got in and so far perfect with exceptional service and professional attitudes from all the staff!! I was pleasantly surprised and glad I’m here. Marriott you rock!!Read moreDate of stay: August 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
