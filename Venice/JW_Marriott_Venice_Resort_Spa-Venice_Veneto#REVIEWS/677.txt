We stayed at the JW Marriott Venice for three nights at the tail end of a Rome, Amalfi, Capri, and Venice Italy trip. The stay was incredible.  The hotel resort is on its own island and can be reached by complementary ferries between San Marco and the hotel that run every 30 minutes from approximately 8 am to shortly after midnight.

We are delighted to hear that you had an incredible stay at our magical Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your kind comments about our luxurious rooms, wonderful rooftop pool, impeccable customer service and fantastic restaurants.  I think that Venice is an ideal location to establish a base for an Italian or European trip. Our airport is the third biggest in the country with connections to almost every single cosmopolitan city in the world and direct flights to several cities in Europe. Furthermore, the train system can take you to Milan, Rome, Florence or even as south as Napoli. We always encourage our customers to spend four or five nights in our resort and have a vacation within a vacation.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
