The hotel is beautiful, located in a quiet private island. The grounds are vast. The staff go above and beyond to make your stay memorable. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. (Thank you to both Anas from Barcelona, Gabriel from Rome, Holden from the US...). The junior suite was of the perfect size and had a balcony. The adult pool has an amazing view of Venice's skyline. The kids pool is next to a restaurant and a gelato cart. The shuttle has a convenient schedule and always on time. The "Cucina" restaurant has a pizza-pasta buffet for dinner. The chef was happy to accommodate my gluten free diet.  Thanks for a wonderful experience. I highly recommend this Marriott location.

We are grateful for your generous comments about our beautiful hotel, quiet island, vast grounds, friendly and welcoming staff and convenient shuttle service.  We hope you had the chance to explore our private island by bicycle. One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with friends, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
