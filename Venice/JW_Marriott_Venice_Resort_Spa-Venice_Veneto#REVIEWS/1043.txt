We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful rooms, wonderful breakfast, awesome views, wonderful spa and peaceful grounds.  I agree, I think our private island is an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort. Some guests even tell us that on some days they don’t leave our island!  We hope to welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again soon – this time for a longer stay!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
