We went in August of 2015, when it was very warm and crowded in Venice.  The JW Marriott on Isola Della Rose was wonderful.  The rooms were spacious by European standards, the beds were incredibly comfortable, excellent linens, robes & slippers.  The hotel was neatly and classically decorated and the AC was nice and chilly.  There is a shuttle boat to take you to and from the mainland near St. Mark's Square every 30 minutes.  The staff was kind, accommodating, and spoke many languages.  The food was very good and not overpriced.  The rooftop pool, lounge and restaurant had beautiful views of the water and of Venice  There were families, children, teenagers, couples and groups of friends, so it's truly good for all sorts of people.  I highly recommend it!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 8, 2015Dear Jen,  How lovely it was to read your review of our JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa!
