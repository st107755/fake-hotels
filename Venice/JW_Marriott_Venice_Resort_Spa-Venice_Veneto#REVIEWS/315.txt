The hotel is located on it's own island which looks across towards Venice about 2 to 3 miles away. You get there on the private hotel boat which takes about 20 minutes. The island presumably was at one time a private island of a very rich family which had it's own magnificent church. We did not stay in the actual hotel, as we were upgraded to a separate building  called L'Uliveto with it's own concierge staffed by Gabriele & Eva, who were extremely helpful on many occasions..  I should also mention Lara and staff at family pool, and Lorenzo & Frederico at the Rose Bar who made our stay more enjoyable. A great hotel to stay at, but with the overheads of such a wonderful location you do pay extra. Definitely worth the experienceRead moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
