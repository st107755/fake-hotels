First of all we are pleased to hear that you consider our hotel amazing, in a great location, very well preserved and with lovely rooms and grounds.   These are all very positive comments and are very encouraging as once the problems that you have outlined will be fixed we may have an opportunity to welcome you again since you are often in the city.
