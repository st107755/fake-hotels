I am delighted to hear that you and your friends enjoyed Chef Mickiâ€™s cooking class. Many of our guests tell us how much they enjoy this activity so I am really glad that it was a marvelous experience with superb food.  At our resort we believe in fresh, wholesome and organic ingredients for our culinary offering. We also carefully select all our organic fruit and vegetables from local farmers, as well as using some produce from our own botanic garden. We feel that this really makes a difference in the quality of the food that we provide to our guests.  Thank you for recommending this fun activity and we hope to welcome you back to our Isola delle Rose again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
