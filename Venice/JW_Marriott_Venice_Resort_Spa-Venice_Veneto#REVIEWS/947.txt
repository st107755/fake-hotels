We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful hotel, fabulous staff and nice rooms.  We hope that your children had the chance to check out our Kids Club. When the team and I were brainstorming the activities for the Kids Club program, we wanted to offer something that would incorporate aspects of Italian culture so that the children would get to know the history and traditions of our beautiful country. Some of the activities that we are proud to offer families include Italian language lessons, creating and painting your own mini gondola and making Venetian masks.  However, I am also very sorry to hear that there were aspects of your stay that you felt warranted improvement. As you know with it being high season our resort is extremely busy.  With regards to your comments about our shuttle service to and from Venice, please note that the dock we have in San Marco is regulated by the Commune de Venezia. We have an allocated time slot for the use of the dock as we are sharing it with two other hotels. Therefore even if we increased the number of our shuttles, we would still only be allowed to arrive on the dock every half an hour. We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you and your family again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
