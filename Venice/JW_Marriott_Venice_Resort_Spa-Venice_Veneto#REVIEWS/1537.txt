The hotel was not really ready to open.  No air conditioning in hallways, dining area and rooms.  Had to wait over an hour after being put in a room wi no AC!! Many other guests had the same experience.  The room looked more like a Courtyard by Marriottt than a JW !!!! Very, very disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Direttore vendite at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 24, 2015Dear Valued Guest, Many thanks for taking the to share your feedback. As you rightly mentioned in your review we have experienced several problems with our AC system that we are currently fixing. Very few rooms are still affected and the hotel is going back to normality. We are really sorry about the inconvenience with the AC and we are sorry to hear that you found our rooms disappointing.  Our rooms are in fact in average the largest in Venice and designed by the famous architect Matteo Thun. Their style is contemporary which is in contrast with what is offered from other hotels in the city. Most of the rooms feature balconies, terraces, gardens or patios which grant additional space. So far the comments on our rooms and setting of the resort have been very enthusiastic. We hope you will give us a second chance and we are sure that with a properly functioning air conditioning you will see the resort and its rooms under a totally different perspective  Cristiano Cabutti Director of Sales & MarketingRead more
