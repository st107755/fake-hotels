A brief note to thank the JW Marriott  team for the wonderful experience we had.  The hotel is amazing, full of top-notch design at every corner, and the team is very kind and professional (Specially the front office manager, Carlos), who made our stay very special.

We appreciate your generous comments about our amazing staff, beautiful hotel and top-notch design.  I am also pleased to hear that you and your group had a wonderful dining experience at Dopolavoro. Your kind words about our beautiful, sophisticated and unique restaurant mean a lot to us. Our resort is a culinary destination in Venice – only six months after its opening Dopolavoro obtained its first Michelin star under the leadership of one of Italy’s most celebrated chefs, Giancarlo Perbellini and his team. As you experienced, what is offered is a traditional but unique gastronomic experience. The restaurant is surrounded by our organic botanical gardens, which not only provide guests with a beautiful setting, but also a wide variety of produce that we use in our dishes. It is a luxury dining experience that is not to be missed.  Thank you for choosing to stay at our magical Isola delle Rose and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
