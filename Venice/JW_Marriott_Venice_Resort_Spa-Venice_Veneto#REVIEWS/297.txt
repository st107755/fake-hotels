My name is Carlos Arpal and I am the Director of Rooms at the JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa. It has come to my attention that the service you received during your recent stay did not meet your expectations. For this, I sincerely apologize.  The experience you described is not characteristic of the level of service we provide. I was very concerned to learn that some members of our staff were not accommodating and kind to you. As a JW Marriott property, we have very high standards for service and all interactions our associates have with our guests should be directed towards making guests feel valued. Needless to say that I will address this matter and will make sure that this does not occur to any further guest.  Once again, I apologize for the disappointment and I hope that in the future we will be able to serve you again and leave a different impression on you. Should you ever visit Venice again, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Sincerely, Carlos Arpal - Director of RoomsRead more
