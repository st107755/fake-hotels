What a beautiful property... This was the best of our Italy tour. Service was excellent, rooms beautifully decorated, food superb, and the pool- wonderful view and perfect... Regular boat to the city center allowed for easy visits but we looked forward to an early return to the resort daily. We did not want to leave.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
