We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful property, amazing staff, excellent amenities and gorgeous views.  As you noticed, our Isola delle Rose has a rich history. Its position, halfway between the lagoon and sea, has given the island a special microclimate, which has encouraged the growth of plants and trees rare in Venice such as our 100 olive trees and inspired the establishment of a clinic of respiratory ailments at the beginning of the 20th century. We are proud of the historical roots of our private island and love to share the beauty of our grounds with our guests.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again in the future.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
