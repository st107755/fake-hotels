We are delighted to hear that you and your family had a wonderful stay at our magical Isola delle Rose. We appreciate all your kind comments about our spacious rooms, friendly and polite staff, relaxing atmosphere, superb breakfast and fun excursions.  Did you and your family have the chance to explore our private island by bicycle? One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with loved ones, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
