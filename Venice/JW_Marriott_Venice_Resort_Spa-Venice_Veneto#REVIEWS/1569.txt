We arrived for a destination wedding expecting an extraordinary experience but can't say we were overwhelmed. The room was lovely and comfortable. Bathroom was adequate but couldn't believe that you could not use the hair dryer in the bathroom and the only place you could plug in the hair dryer was in the bedroom where there was no mirror! The mirror was in a small hallway between the bathroom and bathroom but no outlet. Took 3 tries and 24 hours to get an extension cord. The bathroom also had no place to put your toiletries. Hallway would have been better used to make the bathroom larger with two sinks and shelving of some sort.The service left much to be desired in the restaurant in the main building.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
