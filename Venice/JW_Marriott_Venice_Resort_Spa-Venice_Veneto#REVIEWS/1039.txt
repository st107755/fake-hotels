Good modern clean hotel on a separate island from venice central. The free hotel shuttle to/from st mark square is very punctual and leaves every 30 minutes which makes it quite convenient. Lots of amenities on the private island- 3 restaurants, 3 pools, fitness gym, spa, bike rentals etc.  The michelin star restaurant onsite is AMAZING albeit EXPENSIVE   But improvements please ...  1. Dinner buffet in "cucina" needs to have much more selection for this class of hotel  2. Too much of a cash grab -- eg. Venice fireworks celebration, the hotel charged 25 euro for a viewing spot with a glass of champagne. As a guest I should be able to take advantage of the public viewing spot without having to pay for it! Same with the spa pool...35 euros for guests to use???
