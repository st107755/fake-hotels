Exceptional stay. Rooms are incredible and pool area exceptional. Due to a scheduling problem we were forced to leave a day earlier but staff couldnt have been nicer. Angelo, director of sales and Tore Skog could not have been more accomodating. They made sure we had further hotel and took care f all moving logistics. Staff is second to one. Again JW proves why its the best Marriott property Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
