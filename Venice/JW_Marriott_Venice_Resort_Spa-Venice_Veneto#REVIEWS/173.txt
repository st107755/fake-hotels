Everything about this hotel was perfect. From their professional and friendly staff to the cleanliness of the room, the free shuttle that transports hotel guests to San Marco and back to the hotel. Highly recommend this hotel to families as we were travelling with a baby.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
