Went to this on business with General Motors. An amazing experience spend just the one night there but wow, food superb, room immaculate and staff fluent in English and couldn't do enough for you. Long water taxi but worth it if you take in some sights rather than direct there. Worth a visit to roof top bar, stunning viewsRead moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 8, 2017Dear Stumacher, thanks for your positive feedback. We are grateful for your generous comments about our beautiful resort, first-class service, superb food, immaculate rooms and stunning views.  I have noticed that many guests plan a trip to Venice for only a few nights, but the feedback I have received from all of them afterwards is that they wished they stayed longer. Our guests are pleasantly surprised by the many activities that we have as well as our amazing facilities, such as the GOCO Spa. We always encourage our guests to book a longer stay â€“ at least four or five nights so that they can experience all the wonderful things that we offer.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
