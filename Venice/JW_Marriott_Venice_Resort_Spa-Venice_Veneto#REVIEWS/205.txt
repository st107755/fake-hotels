amazing place. it is kinda private island of marriott and u have everything u want. very kids friendly and personal space for adults too. u can just explore the island with kids.  staff is really great only issue (thought not an issue for me): it is bit a distance from main island from venice, but marriott runs ferry throughout a day with 30 min interval. and i didnt see issue with that. u kinda get a boar ride with it and also get quiet time on this island.   if u r in venice and budget is not an issue. just go with it. nothing better than this.  FYI.. it is not connected by road. so ferry is only option. but its an experience, not to complaint. well, almost whole venice is like that. no cars in venice island. its water and boats all around.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
