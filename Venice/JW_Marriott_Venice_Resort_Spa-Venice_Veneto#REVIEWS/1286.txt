The entire island has recently been completely renovated to great standards.  The style is light and airy (lots of light, white marble, glass and mirrors). Bikes are available. Rooms are large and comfortable. The buffet is excellent (American style with Italian ingredients). Super friendly staff as well.  In Venice, you can quickly get overwhelmed by the number of tourists roaming the streats. I really enjoyed being able to jump on a private shuttle and relax on a private island.  Wifi worked well on the entire island! (even outside).  A very positive experience!Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Mar 21, 2016Dear OBM97, thank you so much for taking the time to write a review. We are really grateful for your kind comments about our light and airy design, large rooms and friendly staff.  What we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to Venice proper means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style. We are happy to hear that you found our resort to be a peaceful oasis away from the tourist frenzy.  Thank you for choosing JW Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
