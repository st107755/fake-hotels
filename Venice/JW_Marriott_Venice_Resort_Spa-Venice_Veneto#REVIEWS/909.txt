Having heard several negitive reviews of Venice (smell & cleanliness) we decided to stay at JW Marriott's "Isola Delle Rose" Island.  We were not disappointed, a beautiful location with all the amenities you would require for a tranquil vacation.  The views from the rooftop restaurant of Venice were outstanding & the serenity of the Island made a pleasant break from the hussle bustle of Venice.  The regular complimentary Transportation Boat gave you easy access to Venice daily.  Attentative Staff, fabulous restaurants and amenities allow you to remain on the Island if you wish to just enjoy the Venitian sun.  We will definitely return...!!

We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful location, outstanding views, serene environment, attentive staff and convenient shuttle service.  I agree, I think our rooftop restaurant Sagra is one of the best vantage points to admire breathtaking 360-degree views of Venice and the Lagoon. It is also the ideal place to watch the beautiful Venetian sunset. Many guests tell us how much they enjoy spending Happy Hour there while indulging in a glass of prosecco and some tapas from our Cicchetti Menu. It is an experience not to be missed.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
