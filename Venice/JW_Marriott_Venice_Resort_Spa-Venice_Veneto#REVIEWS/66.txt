The JW was a lovely break from the hustle and bustle of Venice. St. Mark's Square is just a boat ride away, with free boat transfers leaving ever 30 minutes from morning until midnight. It has 2 pools, an 18+ infinity pool and a large family pool. The spa is an added cost but very lovely, with a nice private pool and massages. The gym is incredibly nice, with air conditioning, nice equipment and showers. The highlight of this place was definitely our pasta cooking class with Luigi. I believe he has 3 different types of classes, but it's definitely a great way to learn how to cook authentic Italian cuisine.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
