The hotel and staff were outstanding.  Although some of the hotel was off limits due to Audi booking the entire building the temporary restaurant in the church was perfect.  The rooms were fantastic, the food to die for.  John (the Aussie) took care of us at breakfast and gave us tips on seeing Venice.  The lady with short dark hair took great care of us at dinner in the church.  The resort is a great way to get away from the crowds.  I would NEVER stay in Venice itself due to the maddening crowds day and night.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
