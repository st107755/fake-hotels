The JW Marriott was the prefect choice for our trip to Venice in August. It was so nice we decided to stay an extra day. The hotel is located on an island so it is far away from the madness that is San Marco. The shuttle runs every 30 minutes which makes getting to the sites pretty easy. The staff was fantastic across the board. The infinity pool was awesome and the rooftop bar was a great place to end the day with a relaxing drink. The rooms were modern and comfortable. Food and beverages were not inexpensive but reasonable for a resort of this caliber.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
