It’s not a cheap hotel but really lovely. We had a great holiday here celebrating our daughter’s 21st birthday last April. The hotel shuttle boat to mainland Venice is easy to use and regular. Staff very good, rooms great. The infinity rooftop pool area does get very busy at times, staff are very attentive but there is not a lot of seating when times are busy but that can’t be helped. Ate at hotel one night in rooftop restaurant - lovely views. Hotel grounds lovely and it’s nice to explore and find different places to sit and relax. After exploring Venice it was nice to go back to the island and sit on the rooftop bar to have a nightcap. Gave us a great family holiday.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
