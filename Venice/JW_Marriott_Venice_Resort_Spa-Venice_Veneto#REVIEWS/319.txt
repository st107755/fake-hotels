After a 9+ hour flight, we started with a private water taxi from the airport, ending with a true "James Bond" arrival at the resort. What an entrance!!! The ONLY way to arrive, IMO! Upon arrival, our suite was ready. Oh, the suite! It was quite large with a full balcony and gorgeous bathroom with a freestanding bath, shower, double vanity, and bidet. It also featured a coffee station and a large walk-in closet. We quickly changed and headed to the lovely rooftop pool with views of Venice for the afternoon. This is where we spent the majority of our days getting some sun and enjoying fresh seafood and chilled wine, only going over to the city center in the evenings for dinner and a stroll after the tourist crowds dissipated a bit. Mind you, this was mid-May and tourist seasonâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
