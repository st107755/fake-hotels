The hotel was beautiful, new, and clean.  We were upgraded to a Jr. Suite and it was fantastic.  There was a large soaking tub and a separate shower.  We were only in Venice 2 nights and were not able to take advantage of all the amenities.  The rooftop pool overlooking Venice was beautiful, however the restaurant near the pool was overpriced and honestly not very good, I would skip it.  But do not skip the buffet breakfast, it was great.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 8, 2015Dear Sir,  We would like to thank you for your detailed feedback.
