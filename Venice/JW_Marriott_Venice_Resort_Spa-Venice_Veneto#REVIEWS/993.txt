We had a recent stay with our 2 children (12& 15).  Exceptional property with lots of room for kids to play, bike ride, etc.  Also, have a separate family pool on the property with plenty of room for the kids to play.  Compared to the cramped accommodations in Venice, this was a blessing.  We had a couple of the lofted suites which were extremely roomy.  Breakfast was very good.  Dinner at Sagara was ok but not exceptional.   The hotel shuttle to Venice worked without a hitch.

We appreciate your kind comments about our exceptional property, good breakfast and straightforward shuttle service.  I am delighted to hear that you and your family were able to explore our private island by bicycle. As you mentioned, one of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with loved ones, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
