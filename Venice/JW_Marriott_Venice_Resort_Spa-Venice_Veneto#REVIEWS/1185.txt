Amazing Property with each and every staff in the hotel treating you like some gift at their home. We had a memorable experience staying at JW Marriott Venice. Located on a private island has ferry service to St.Marks in every 30 minutes connecting you to the main city. Outstanding food and a large breakfast spread to choose from. Give all credit to the General Manager of this hotel who is able to keep each member so motivated and offer such a delightful experience to guests.. Must visit place for everyone.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 19, 2016Dear Shivdutt, thanks so much for sharing your feedback on our resort.
