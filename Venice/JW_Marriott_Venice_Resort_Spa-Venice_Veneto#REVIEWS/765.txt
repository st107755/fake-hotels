Anyone perusing this review looking for an option should really consider this resort, located on its own island, with its own water transport to and from Venice main island, runs every 30 minutes, journey takes 30 minutes. A top class, high quality resort (we stayed in a very spacious junior suite), every single member of staff super attentive, polite, helpful, making sure our stay even more enjoyable. It's a genuine 5* resort, the Spa (detached and on a separate part of island, short stroll from main hotel) also amazing. This resort brings a touch of tranquility to you after enjoying the hustle and bustle of Venice. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 18, 2017Dear Garethjlane, thanks for your positive review.
