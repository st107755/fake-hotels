One of the best hotels I have stayed at. Simply stunning views across to Venice. 3 pools, roof top, spa and family pool. The family pool was well heated and the children loved it. However, I was very disappointed by the lack of variety on the menu at the family pool. There wasn't even a kids menu there??! The menu at the Sagra restaurant was also limited. Improve these and the hotel can become even better. Service was very good and I had a brilliant stay and will definitely be back.
