We stayed at the JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa for one night prior to going on a cruise.  The property was beautiful.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The hotel lobby was modern, bright and clean.  Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was quite luxurious.  The hotel is located on its own island which is about 20 minutes by boat from St Mark's Square.  The hotel has multiple buildings and you can walk around the property, which we quite enjoyed doing in the morning.  The property is expensive and we found the cost of lunch to be excessive (average 25 Euro a plate).  Otherwise, we quite enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back if we were in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 18, 2015Dear Mark,  Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor.
