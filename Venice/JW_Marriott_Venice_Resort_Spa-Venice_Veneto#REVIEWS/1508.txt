The staff are excellent apart from the restaurant on the roof top. The were slow and not very efficient. took 4 people and 20 minutes to get the bill. The pool is too small but then again, was too busy being in Venice to care that much. The boat connection was very punctual and regular so you didn't feel like waiting too long for a connection. The concierge didn't know much about things but was trying his best. The breakfast was varied but the coffee was very weak  I did enjoyed very much and will go back again for sure.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 26, 2015Dear Sir,  We would like to thank you for your detailed feedback.
