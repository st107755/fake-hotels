What an amazing hotel!!! We arrived a la James Bond in a water taxi right into the hotel lobby. The rooms were lovely. We had a small balcony.  The bathroom smells a little like cat pee. Our friends had the same issue. Must be the drain.  The hotel is beautiful. The roof top pool has views to die for. However, there aren't many loungers up there and there were kids in the pool. My other issue was that people reserved seats and then left. No cool!!  The breakfast was amazing and the lounge meals we had were also lovely.   It would be nice if the hotel coordinated airport taxi. Its 120Euro and there was another couple waiting to leave the same time we were. We could have shared..... good for the environment as well as my wallet.   Will be back.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 7, 2015Dear Catherine,  Thanks for your review;  we are happy to know that you enjoyed your recent stay with us and have been impressed by our "James Bond" style arrival, with your private water taxi arriving directly at the hotel main entrance.
