Island hotel at Venice is beautiful resort hotel which is about 20 mins away from San Marco only and if you coming from any other place, you can only reach by hiring boat taxi. Hotel has boat shuttle every 30 mins to and from San Marco. This was our last leg of Italy trip and I am glad we stayed the hotel. We will cherish the stay as the staff is fantastic and will do all they can to make your stay comfortable. Rooms are nice, rooftop pool/ restaurant provide great view and good breakfast at the main dining area. Kids club was really good where our son enjoyed activities and played with other kids. My only recommend is to include food from other countries (most common ones) in their menu so as to make it more global hotel. Overall, excellent stay at the J W Marriott Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 1, 2017Dear Ajay D, thank you so much for your review. We are grateful for your generous comments about our beautiful resort, fantastic staff, nice rooms, great views and good breakfast.  I am also glad to hear that your son enjoyed our Kids Club. Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our property provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very kids-friendly, with a family pool, interactive water fountain, playground as well as a fun Adventure Park.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
