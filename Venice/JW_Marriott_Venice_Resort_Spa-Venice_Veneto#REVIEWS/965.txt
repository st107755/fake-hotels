We are absolutely delighted to hear that you and your family enjoyed your time at our resort. We appreciate your kind comments about our splendid and classy hotel, friendly staff and impeccable service.  When the team and I were brainstorming the activities for the Kids Club program, we wanted to offer something that would incorporate aspects of Italian culture so that the children would get to know the history and traditions of our beautiful country. Some of the activities that we are proud to offer families include Italian language lessons, creating and painting your own mini gondola and making Venetian masks.

Thank you for choosing to stay at our magical Isola delle Rose and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
