We stayed at the JW Marriott for our first visit to Venice and we loved it.Amazing Hotel, wonderful rooms and the most important an exceptionally welcoming staff.Everybody from the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out were extremely friendly and helpful.The room was amazing and comfortable . If it wasn't for venice we could have stayed in this property 24 hours. I can only higly recommended and for sure i will be back. Thank you everyone for the great serviceRead moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
