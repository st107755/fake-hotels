Thoroughly enjoyed our stay, plus they have the amazing Goco Spa on site, where the massages and facials were exceptional!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 6, 2017Dear mabeck50, thank you for your review.
