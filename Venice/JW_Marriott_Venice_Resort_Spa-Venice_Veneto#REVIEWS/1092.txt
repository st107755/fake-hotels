We stayed three days at the hotel in June, celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. The staff is extremely serviced minded and they will do everything to make your stay as pleasant as possible.   The rooms are perfect. The rooftop terrace with heated pool and a fantastic view over Venice is the best place to be at the hotel.  Perfect breakfast and we also loved the Sagra rooftop restaurant. The people at Sagra made a surprise for us and it was very charming. Dopolavoro Dining Room with a Michelin star is an adventure.  The site is so beautiful – we highly recommend it.  Disadvantages? It is expensive..Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 23, 2016Dear NordicBergen_Norge, thanks so much for your wonderful feedback.
