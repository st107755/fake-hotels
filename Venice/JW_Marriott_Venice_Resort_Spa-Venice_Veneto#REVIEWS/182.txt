We are currently staying at the JW Marriott in one of the La Maisonette Pool Loft Suites that we would highly recommend. Very private setting with a heated jacuzzi plunge pool. However please stay away from the Spa Facilities that are extremely dirty especially the pool and the steam room. The spa staff is rude with no customer service skills whatsoever.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Front Office Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 7, 2018Dear Alicja N,  thank you for sharing your valuable feedback in regards of your current experience at the JW Marriott Venice.
