This hotel on Isola della Rosa is a delight.  It's on it's own island in the lagoon with a very comfortable shuttle across to San Marco every thirty minutes.  The island is really lovely and the hotel rooms are spacious and comfortable.  The rooftop bar and pool are a welcome oasis amid the crowds of Venice and the view is exceptional.  We loved it all and would go back.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 19, 2016Dear Tellenbach, thanks for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our lovely island, spacious and comfortable rooms and exceptional views from our rooftop pool and bar.  I think our private island is an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort. Some guests even tell us that on some days they donâ€™t leave our island!  We hope to welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
