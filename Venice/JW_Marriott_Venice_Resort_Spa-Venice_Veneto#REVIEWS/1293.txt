The hotel is accessible by boat. It's actually pretty quick, about 20 min if you don't miss the shuttle and the hotel offers free water.   The hotel is located on an island, it separates the resort (families) from main hotel and has a very nice spa too. We were very well welcomed by the staff and treated with an upgrade to a suite. This was unexpected as we have no status with Marriott and paid the cheapest prepaid rate.   It's a very nice place, great service, great breakfast, but overpriced restaurant. Not a charming original but very neat hotel. If you have time you can spend half a day on the grounds alone.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Mar 19, 2016Dear FloLS, thank you for taking the time to review our resort. We appreciate all your generous comments about our charming and luxurious property, great customer service and delicious breakfast.  At our resort we believe in fresh, wholesome and organic ingredients for our culinary offering. Our Chefs make our pasta fresh everyday by following family recipes handed down from generation to generation. We also carefully select all our organic fruit and vegetables from local farmers. We feel that this really makes a difference in the quality of the food that we provide to our guests.  Thanks for choosing Marriott and we hope to welcome you back again soon.
