The staff as always make the stay wonderful but every little detail was thought about and executed to perfection here. I had arranged a romantic package for a wedding proposal and the team that helped me ( Valentina ) were exceptional. They seemed to genuinely care about your experience and their job which makes for a perfect balance :) the accommodation was incredible and we had a junior suite with all the associated luxuries. The gardens, the room top pool and the boat shuttle from Venice to the hotel are out of this world. Thank you. Best hotel and team I have ever encountered:) Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 5, 2017Dear Marley3012, thank you so much for your review.
