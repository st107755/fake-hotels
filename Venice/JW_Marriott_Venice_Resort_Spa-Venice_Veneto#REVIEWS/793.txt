My wife and I spent five days at the resort. It was the middle of November, so the weather wasn't ideal and the high-end restaurant was closed, but we had a wonderful time. The property itself is special, and we can't say enough nice things about the staff. Everyone we met was remarkably kind and accommodating. We especially enjoyed our cooking class with Micki Milan and our nights at the bar with Vincenzo. It's a beautiful place with wonderful people. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 25, 2016Dear Chad J, thanks for your review.
