From the early e-mails with instructions on how to take the Vaporetto and shuttle to the hotel grounds, to the warm reception upon arrival, to the incredible attention to detail provided to us by Sara Scolaro, Oscar, Anna, Elsa, and Andrea, to the amazing room and terrace, to the olive trees and beautiful grounds, to the infinity pool overlooking Venice...(I could go on)... we could not have asked for a more amazing experience.  The staff was also so very helpful in tracking down our luggage (at that point it had been delayed for 7 days) and having it delivered by boat to our hotel.  The first thing we did when we arrived . home is to figure out when we can go back.  Swim, don't run to this hotel -- you will not be disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 28, 2017Dear markyac2015, thanks for your review.
