Stayed at the JW Marriott for 7 days at the start of July (still here now), each day has its up's and down's. I've not been on holiday in a long time, but I would of thought a 5 star hotel should be better than this. The hotel itself is very nice, being on a quiet island away from the hussle of Venice, with lots of gardens to walk around. The shuttle back and forth from the island to Venice was very convenient, sometimes it ran a little slow and would take almost 30 minutes (not sure this is a fault of the hotel though), other times it would only take 10 minutes.  When we arrived check-in was nice and fast, though a tad confusing. The staff were friendly but the bell boy was quite rude and hung around expecting a tip - I hate this, I only tip if the member of staff goes aboveâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Direttore vendite at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 26, 2015Dear Valued Guest, Thank you very much for taking the time to share your very constructive comments. We are very pleased to read that you enjoyed the resort, its grounds and setting on its private island away from bustling Venice. Our shuttle connects our island to St. Mark's Square every 30 minutes and it takes in average in between 15 to 20 minutes. We are sorry to read that some of our services didn't match your expectations. Your notes will certainly help us to deliver a better service. With regards to the WIFI, if you enroll to our loyalty program Marriott Rewards, this service will be free of charge, not only in the public areas where the service is already free of charge, but also in the room. We can reassure that for your next visit in Venice the problems will be fixed. We look forward to welcoming you soon again  Cristiano Cabutti Director of Sales & MarketingRead more
