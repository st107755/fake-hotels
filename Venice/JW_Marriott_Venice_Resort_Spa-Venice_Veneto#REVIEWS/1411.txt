This hotel only opened in March 2015 and there have been teething problems. Our 'deluxe' room was disappointing. We had a small window overlooking the fire escape and trees blocked any view we may have had of Venice. Having said that, the location was great 15 mins by complimentary launch to Piazza San Marco. The staff were very courteous and helpful at all times - especially Valentino at the Rooftop Restaurant, which incidentally is amazing especially at sunset!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 8, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for your kind review and for having indicated our property as a great location.
