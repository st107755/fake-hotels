We spent 4 nights in this adorable new, comfortable and luxurious resort in the venetian lagoon. We were very satisfied with the convenience of the whole resort and the outstanding service. The complete staff works hard for the first class service, especially during the breakfast. We will never forget the warm and attentive care we experienced by Laura, Maurizio, Enrico and the whole "Breakfast Team". Our room was tasteful decorated and very spacious. One of the daily highlights was the shuttle from the hotel to St. Marks place and vice versa.

All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager  Read more
