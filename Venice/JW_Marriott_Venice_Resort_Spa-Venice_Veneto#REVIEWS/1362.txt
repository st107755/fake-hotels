You can only expect the best from a JW Marriott resort and this hotel really represents the magic of the brand. If you go to the restaurant don't miss the five course platter prepare to be delighted. You will enjoy a beautiful boat shuttle to the private island. My advice is to email the concierge they will help you reserve a water taxi for your shuttle from the airport to the hotel. It costs about â‚¬120 each way but you'll save a lot of time. I took the water bus that takes 1:30 hours just to get to San Marco.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
