We stayed for six days at the end of October, beginning of November.  Arriving by water taxi we were driven straight into the dock in the hotel, it was quite spectacular and a wonderful way to start our holiday.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  As we signed in we were given a complementary glass of sparkling wine and then shown our rooms which were a good size and very comfortable.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 10, 2017Dear Hilary C, thanks for your wonderful feedback.
