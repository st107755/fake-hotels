A fabulous location, and a stunning property. The view of Venice is unforgettable, and our duplex apartment, with its own plunge pool, was simple gorgeous.  But the service was so mediocre. We waited ages to be seated at dinner, despite having a reservation, it was almost importable to order a drink from a waitress and yet they objected when we visited the bar in person, there was litter at the side of the pool which wasn't moved all day, poolside service was non-existent ...  6 star real estate with a 4 star management.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 13, 2016Dear SezzleSW19, thanks for your review.
