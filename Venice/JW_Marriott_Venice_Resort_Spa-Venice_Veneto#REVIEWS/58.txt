The JW in Venice is a beautiful hotel. We had a corner room which enabled us to see beautiful sunsets. The bed was very comfortable, but we didnâ€™t like the pillows. The bathroom was clean and well stocked except for wash cloths. The exercise facility is well equipped. The breakfast is sumptuous and well staffed. The water shuttle to the city is comfortable and right on time. Early departure and late arrival are problematic in that you have to pay extra for airport transfers. It is a gorgeous, well maintained property with a very helpful staff. We would happily stay there again. Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
