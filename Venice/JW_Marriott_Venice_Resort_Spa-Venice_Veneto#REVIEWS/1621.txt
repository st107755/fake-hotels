We have had a big size +100 people conference in late April. This unique property is equipped with its own conference facilities with the modern technology. The conference is built is a separate building - surrounded by the great nature and Laguna view. Open air patio around is a very good addition for having small cocktail. the Chappel situated in the island can be used for the gala dinner. Overall this is an excellent property. As it was just opened we did not see the spa, but the island and walk around is very calm. The roof pool is wit the great view towards the Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 3, 2015Dear Olga,  We would like to thank you for your nice review.
