Located on its own island with park and boat shuttle makes the hotel a perfect choice for chillaxin. Unfortunately we have been there in autumn so we couldnÂ´t enjoy the rooftop pool, which provides you a wonderful view. The service fits to what you would expect if you book the marriot.  The breakfast area is much to small for this kind of hotel (in principle its a no go if you pay that price and than have to wait to have breakfast, although I have to admit we have been always early enough)Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Mar 21, 2016Dear C4929WUthomasm, thanks for your review.
