I just returned from an amazing weekend at JW Venice Resort and Spa. My friends and myself have spent a weekend on this beautiful island! We have enjoyed every single moment! The private transfer was organized and up on arrival everything was perfectly prepared. Our room was outstanding, beautiful view and very clean. The Rooftop Restaurant Sagra was amazing, the food delicious and the staff always helpful. Worth pointing out is the island itself! From the arrival till the moment we had to leave, we felt like staying somewhere fare away from everything! It was just an amazing quiet and very relaxing place! Thanks for making our weekend unforgettable! We will definitely come back!
