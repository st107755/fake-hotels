This may be the ultimate JW property for service, property, and amenities. It has to die for views of Venice from this island property and wonderful dining options in and outside. From the moment we checked in with Ginevra who was so gracious and personable ( first impressions go a long way) we felt right at home after a long flight. The property is immaculate and vibrant with each staff member always greeting you with a smile and desire to help. Shout out to Bogdan who seemed to be everywhere between the pool, lobby bar and Sagra restaurant on top of the hotel. Can’t say enough about this resort and will definitely return as it’s a welcome respite from the hustle of Venice, yet only a quick complimentary water taxi to the city itself.
