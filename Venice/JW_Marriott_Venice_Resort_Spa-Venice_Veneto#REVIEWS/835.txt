Really cool hotel on its own private island. Service, food, rooms, everything was excellent. Rooftop pool and bar have great views of Venice. Only thing I would warn is that because this hotel is on its own island, it takes extra time to get there.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 24, 2016Dear Dan O, thanks for your feedback. We appreciate your kind words about our beautiful hotel, great views and excellent food and customer service.  I am delighted to hear that you enjoyed spending time at our rooftop restaurant and pool, Sagra. I think it is one of the best vantage points to admire breathtaking 360-degree views of Venice and the Lagoon. It is also the ideal place to watch the gorgeous Venetian sunset. Many guests tell us how much they enjoy spending Happy Hour there while indulging in a glass of prosecco and some tapas from our Cicchetti Menu. It is an experience not to be missed.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
