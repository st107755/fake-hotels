We went for 5 nights to the hotel. It was fantastic. The communication beforehand, arrival, reception, room service, breakfast restaurant and everywhere else all staff were very nice, professional and helpful and made our stay incredible.  We would have loved to stay longer and will with no doubt come back.  One of the highlights was the dinner at dopolavoro which was just perfect and enjoyable.   It is the perfect combination for relaxing on the island and only a boar ride away from the main attractions of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 20161 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 1, 2016Dear kiboko, thanks for your review.
