A truely fabulous place. After the hustle and bustle of Venice we could return to the calm hotel island. Our room was modern and had all the frills you would expect. We had a large terrace with sun loungers and a view over the huge gardens.  The staff make this hotel. Nothing is too much trouble and they are so friendly and caring.  Wonderful food. Prosecco for breakfast. Why not.  We would very much like to return in the future.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 16, 2017Dear themaze22017, thanks for your glowing review.
