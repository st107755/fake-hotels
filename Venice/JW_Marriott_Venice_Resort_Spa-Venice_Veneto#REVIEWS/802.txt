We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful hotel, comfortable and spacious rooms, relaxing atmosphere and nice staff.  As you mentioned, our property is unique in the sense that it is located on its own private island, which is only a short boat ride away from San Marco Square. Many of our guests tell us that they really enjoy the combination of accessibility to Venice and peace and seclusion that our hotel offers after a full day of sightseeing. Being able to provide this oasis of calm is what makes us special and why many of our guests who are frequent visitors of Venice decide to stay with us time and time again.  Thank you for choosing to stay with us and we hope that we can welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again in the future.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
