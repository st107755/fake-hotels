We are Marriott members which I have to say is one of the best things we have ever done. We do a lot of travelling and always if possible go into the Marriott hotels or vacation clubs. Always to date have been more than happy.  Which brings me to our stay at the venice resort.  It is our second visit here. We had the best few days possible. The resort itself is top class. The entrance to the resort is unique by boat straight into the reception. The rooftop pool and restaurant is beautiful. There is also a childrens pool .  We stayed in one of the villas this time which was absolutely amazing to say the least. The staff met us from the boat and took us on a buggy to a separate check in and then onto our villa. The staff were so attentive as always.  It is a very addictive place .â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
