We are delighted that you and your husband enjoyed celebrating his 60th birthday at our magical Isola delle Rose.  We are grateful for your generous comments about our impressive arrival experience, polite and friendly staff, peaceful surroundings, luxurious facilities and professional customer service.  What we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to San Marco Square means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city – but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa.
