Our stay was wonderful. Coming back to the quiet island was an oasis after a day in Venice. The free shuttle back and forth to San Marco was very convenient. Marco at reception was an A+.  Everyone on property was very kind. Our children loved the kids club. Only negative was there are many mosquitos near all the pools. Lots of bites!  Ouch. Bring bug repellent!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 5, 2016Dear Guest, I am thrilled to hear that you had a wonderful stay at our resort. We appreciate your kind comments about our quiet island, convenient shuttle service, kind and attentive staff and fun Kids Club.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as a fantastic Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for choosing the JW Venice and we hope to welcome you and your family back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
