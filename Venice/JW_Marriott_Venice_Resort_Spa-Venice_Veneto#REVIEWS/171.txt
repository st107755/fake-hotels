We are Marriott owners Platinum level. Not staying here but wanted a tour. Our cell phone battery was dead and needed a charge. Our hotel did not have a charger to borrow.  Patricia offered to charge our phone. She gave us a private tour and a fresh beverage. She was so kind to us and answered our questions. Our travel agent could not get us booked at this location as they were fully booked. We made our later day tour because of a charged cell phone! Thank you Patricia! WE hope to return to this beautiful resort.Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
