we stayed here for 2 nights before embarking on a cruise. the island is a restful place--far from the hustle and bustle of Venice. getting to the city and back is easy with the water shuttles. the staff is remarkably helpful--we particularly enjoyed the assistance from Gabriele and Anna in arranging details for our departure.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
