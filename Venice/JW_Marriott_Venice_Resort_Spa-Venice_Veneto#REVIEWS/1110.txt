My wife and two children (6 years and months) were here on holiday. First off the facilities and setting on its own island are wonderful. They really pay special attention to details and ensuring that guests with families and couples can enjoy their stay with swimming pools, activities, and facilities designed for each. We really have to give a special thanks to the kids club. My daughter spent a a couple of hours their each day - one day making masks and the other day taking a children's cooking class (making cookies) in a special teaching kitchen. Carlotta and Teresa are great with the children, go above and beyond, and actually reached out to us after our stay with pictures of the class. Great vacation.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 15, 2016Dear TheNYC4inGeneva, thank you for taking the time to write a review. We appreciate your generous comments about our great hotel, lovely staff and wonderful facilities. I will make sure to pass on your compliments to the Kids Club team â€“ they will be happy to hear that your children enjoyed their time with us.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as an amazing Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you and your family back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
