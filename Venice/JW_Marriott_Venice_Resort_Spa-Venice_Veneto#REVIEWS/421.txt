 A peaceful and chic hotel with amazing facility and a spa with breathtaking views over the lagoon. On a private island, away from the hustle of the town.

We appreciate your generous comments about our peaceful and chic hotel, amazing facilities and breathtaking views.  Our Isola delle Rose – Island of Roses – has a rich history. Its position, halfway between the lagoon and sea, has given the island a special microclimate, which has encouraged the growth of plants and trees rare in Venice and inspired the establishment of a clinic of respiratory ailments at the beginning of the 20th century.

Thanks for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
