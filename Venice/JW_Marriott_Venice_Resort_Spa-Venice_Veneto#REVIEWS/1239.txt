Just the most perfect hotel for a relaxing girlie holiday! The three of us stayed for five luxurious nights. The customer service was excellent with the staff feeling more like old friends, always a smile,a hello & nothing was too much for them. We spent a lot of time at the scenic  rooftop pool eating, drinking, sunbathing. Service was so good that when it was finally time to get out of the pool because it was getting late the man was there with towels at the ready to make sure we didn't get cold! We also ate at Dopolavoro which was an amazing experience, totally recommend going! You see the chefs in the morning gardening so they can use as much local produce as possible! A big thank you to Simone who made us feel very special. He is a very funny warm knowledgeable man!…Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 25, 2016Dear helgagriffiths, thanks so much for your wonderful feedback.
