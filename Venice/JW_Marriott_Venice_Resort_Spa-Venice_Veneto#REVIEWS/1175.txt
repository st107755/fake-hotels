Just finished a 4 day stay at the JW Marriott in Venice. This by far was one of the best Hotels we have stayed at. The room with our own private pool was amazing. The service level from all of their staff was the best I have had at any Marriott. The Guest Relations Manager, Luca was outstanding in his attention to detail.  It was nice to get away from the crowds of Venice by being on your own island. Very nice and peaceful. One of the things they need is some type of small gift shop. They have none. Make sure you bring everything you need for your stay otherwise you need to take their boat into town. Will stay there again the next time we are in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 26, 2016Dear siepka, thanks so much for taking the time to write a review.
