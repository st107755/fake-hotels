Loved our 2 night stay at this beautiful island oasis!  Luca in Guest Relations was most helpful with answering questions & providing recommendations for dining off the island.   While at the resort, we had lunch at the rooftop dining area by the pool.  The special of the day - buffalo mozzarella topped with a walnut half & dab of marmalade drizzled with honey on a bed of greens was the highlight of my culinary experience in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 28, 2016Dear Shirley W, thanks so much for your positive feedback.
