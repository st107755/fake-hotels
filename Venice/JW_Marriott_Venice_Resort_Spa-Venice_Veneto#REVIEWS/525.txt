We were looking forward to stay in the 5 Star JW Marriott Resort & Spa in Venice, away from the city crowd. However there were a few disappointments. It was a bit busy with checking in so we were seated in the lobby. No drinks were offered. We asked how long we had to wait. Ofcourse we know it is busy with checking in that time but we expect something to drink. At last they came with refreshments. We booked 2 rooms, 1 wasnot ready yet. No problem. Reception promised to lay the keys in the "ready"' room. That didnot happen. At last by checking out we were charged with costs from the minibar, we hadnot used. We donot expect this from a 5Star hotel. A bit of a disappointment.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 17, 2017Dear biesjeb62, thank you for your review.
