The JW Marriott in Venice is fantastic. Beautiful exterior, grounds and amenities as well as very modern internally. We highly recommend taking a private water taxi on arrival so you arrive at the "James Bond" water entrance. The amenities are spectacular and the staff even better. In particular, Gianfranco was our waiter for our breakfasts and he was extremely engaging and professional. He kindly taught us some Italian and made the experience for our son fun and entertaining. He was terrific.

We appreciate your kind comments about our fantastic resort, beautiful grounds, spectacular amenities and terrific staff. I will make sure to pass on your compliments to Gianfranco â€“ he will be thrilled to hear that he made such a lasting impression.  We have put together a very exciting and unique summer activity program for guests of all ages, which will include private tours to Murano to watch the traditional art of glass-making as well as the charming island of Burano to meet a traditional lace maker who has been creating and designing beautiful lace products for more than 65 years. We hope that you and your family were able to go on a few of our fun excursions.  Thank you for choosing to stay at our Isola delle Rose and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
