This is an awesome Marriott hotel on its own island in Venice.  Complimentary shuttles every 15 minutes  to San Marco.  The hotel is not only beautiful but since they just opened the staff is unbelievably helpful  I would stay here again five days was just not enough!  The island is a very nice place to just walk around and enjoy, the spa beautiful but of course pricey!  You will be wowed, no place like it, and the rooms are very comfortable!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 29, 2015Dear Ms Diana,  Thank you for your feedback on your recent stay!
