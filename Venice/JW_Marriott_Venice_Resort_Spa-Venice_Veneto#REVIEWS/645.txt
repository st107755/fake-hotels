We appreciate your generous comments about our delightful staff, incredible rooms and five-star food.  We hope that you were able to check out Dispensa during your stay with us.

The inspiration behind our new concept for Dispensa was our desire to bring all the wonderful and traditional products that you would find in any Italian regional market to our guests. We offer a mouthwatering and affordable selection of salami, prosciutto, cheeses and other delicious delicacies from all over Italy. I am also glad to hear that you purchased our Olive Oil, made from the olive trees that grow on our property.
