The main hotel building is very nicely furbished throughout in public areas, the rooms are also tastefully decorated and well equipped. The main areas of disappointment were: the bedroom air conditioning being inadequate, complimentary bottled water running out (for a whole day), room service inconsistently changing towels, the buffet restaurant took a very long time to replenish dishes that ran out. The hotel is on its own small island about 20 minutes complimentary shuttle ride from San Marco.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 8, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor.
