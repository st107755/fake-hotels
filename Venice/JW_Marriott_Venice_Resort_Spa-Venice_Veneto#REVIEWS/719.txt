We appreciate your generous comments about our beautiful grounds, lovely facilities, delicious food and exceptional staff.  Our Isola delle Rose – Island of Roses – has a rich history. Its position, halfway between the lagoon and sea, has given the island a special microclimate, which has encouraged the growth of plants and trees rare in Venice and inspired the establishment of a clinic of respiratory ailments at the beginning of the 20th century. We are proud of the historical roots of our private island and love to share the beauty of our grounds with our guests.  Thanks for choosing the JW Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
