We are so glad we stayed at this hotel so we could get away from the crowds in Venice. Every staff member was extremely friendly and went out of their way to help us. Check-in was quick although we declined letting the porter keep our bags while we waited in the seating area for someone to call us to check-in. We were very tired and ready to get to  our room. If you can, book the water taxi to/from the airport. We used public transport when we arrived and it took 2 1/2 hours to get to the resort. The hotel shuttle to/from Venice was on time every time and never completely full like some others experienced. A five star experience all around!  Food at the rooftop restaurant was very good. Try the Eggplant Parmesan! We brought bug spray in case of mosquitos but never had to use itâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 25, 2016Dear Julie W, thanks so much for your review. We really appreciate your generous comments about our friendly staff, good food and beautiful property.  I am delighted to hear that you enjoyed your dining experience at our Sagra Rooftop Restaurant. You might be interested to hear that besides the regular menu, we also offer a special menu from the Cicchetti Bar, which are Venetian-style tapas. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden. One of my favorite dining experiences is enjoying these Venetian-style tapas while overlooking the dramatic skyline of the Lagoon during sunset at our rooftop.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
