Stayed four days at this lovely hotel and spa. Built on its own island about 15 minutes from San Marco in Venice. Transport is by the Hotel water taxi on a very regular basis. Rooms are large and very comfortable, bathroom excellent. Breakfast was the best I have seen outside of Florida, everything that you could want. We had dinner in the rooftop restaurant and it was superb, not cheap but when in Venice..... The spa looked extremely chic but we did not use the services so cannot comment. Everything was comfortable, relaxed. Helpful and friendly staff. A truly wonderful stay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
