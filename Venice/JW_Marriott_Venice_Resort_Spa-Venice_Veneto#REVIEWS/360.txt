Well what can we say ? We have just had the 2 most memorable days & nights in your hotel . This was our second visit & the staff & management team could not do enough for us . Nothing was too much trouble .  Our suite was stunning & so well thought out , the amenities & true luxurious decor & appointments .  The staff  at reception , breakfast & at the pool & bar, incredible , truly genuine , and going over and above you could expect , from moving umbrellas hourly , making crackers daily & lovely attitudes.  Then last night a spectacular meal 5 course + in the Michelin ðŸŒŸrestaurant Dopolovro every course a culinary masterpiece chef Frederico Belluco at 30years of age your inventive menu and working to dietary requirements was beyond our wildest dreams  .  Thanks so much to youâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
