This was a wonderful property to visit.  Everything about it was five star!  The service was impeccable, the rooms lovely and the food delicious.  The private island is a wonderful escape from bustling St Mark's and other landmarks in Venice.  It was such a lovely place - we hope to go there again for another trip.  Don't miss out on this terrific resort!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 7, 2016Dear mermaid30059, thanks so much for your positive feedback. We really appreciate your generous comments about our wonderful property, five star resort, impeccable customer service, lovely rooms and delicious food.  I agree, what we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to Venice means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a wonderful escape where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope you visit us again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
