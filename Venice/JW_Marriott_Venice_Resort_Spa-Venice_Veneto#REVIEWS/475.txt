The hotel was very nice with exceptionnal services focused on clients. Our room at the 4th floor gives you a kind of VIP feeling as they were only 4 rooms at this level with the best view on San Marco! Thank you for that kind attention as we were celebrating our one year birthday meet. :) Breakfast is awsome and Paolo is all the time at your service cooking fried eggs, omelette or what ever you want.  Wifi and breakfast must be paid and I don't understand why others clients complain on the price as they know they are in a 5 stars hotel... Anyway, you can have wifi for free if you sign in with the Marriott rewards program and also the breakfast included in the price, just look to their promotion...ðŸ˜‰ Next time we will come to Venise, We will come to the JW Marriott! We love thisâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 11, 2017Dear Louis T, thanks for your positive feedback. We appreciate your generous comments about our exceptional customer service, beautiful views and awesome breakfast.
