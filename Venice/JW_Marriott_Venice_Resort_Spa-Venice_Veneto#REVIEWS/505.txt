As expected, JW Marriott was definitely beautiful. The JW Marriott in Venice in particular makes it even more special as it is a little more isolated from the main Venice, which, trust me, you'll appreciate as the Piazza San Marco/Rialto area is packed with tourists.   Everyone was also very friendly and accomodating. A few of them were Bia, Alessandra, Dominika, Cristian, Lorenzo, and Turgut among others. They made our stay at JW Marriott even better.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 25, 2017Dear Bettina M, thank you for your positive feedback.
