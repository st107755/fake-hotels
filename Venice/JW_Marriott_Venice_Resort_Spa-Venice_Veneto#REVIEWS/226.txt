This hotel is amazing. The staff is very friendly. Didnâ€™t realize when I booked it that it was on a private island. Being a Marriott platinum member I was upgraded to an amazing room. The breakfasts at the hotel were outstanding. I really loved this hotel and location.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
