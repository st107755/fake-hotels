Newly opened (about 12 months ago) the hotel offers a unique experience. The hotel property is located on a private island about 25 minutes by (free) hotel water shuttle and covers the entire island. High end amenities, clean and spacious rooms, a good gym, great breakfast and very, very friendly and helpful staff. Concierge was really helpful in giving us suggestions and getting reservations at good restaurants. It is an expensive but totally worthwhile expense and very different from that offered by the Cipriani. wifi is free with a Marriot membership.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 27, 2016Dear Jaap T, thanks so much for your positive feedback.
