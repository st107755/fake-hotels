The hotel itself is amazing but right now it is the hottest time of the year and they are having record high temperatures and the air conditioning in the rooms and all over the hotel basically do not work at all making this stay simply unbearable.   I have travelled all over the world and stayed at some of the best hotels and by far this hotel has to rank as my worst overall experience!!!  And also not to mention the fact that they charge you for wifi in the rooms!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Director of Sales at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 22, 2015Dear Valued Guest,  Thank you very much for taking the time to share your feedback.
