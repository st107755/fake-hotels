I have stayed at many top end hotels and this was excellent from start to finish, the staff are so polite and well trained, the room very comfortable, the shuttle boat into Venice prompt and regular, the breakfast choice reminded me of hotels in the Far East so much to chose from.. Would def stay at this peaceful haven away from the madding crowds of Venice again!  The only down side was the price of the drinks round the pool 15Euro for a spritz and 10 Euro a beer a little steep..  Thanks Steve Surplus.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 1, 2016Dear SteveSManchester, thanks so much for your review. We really appreciate all your wonderful comments about our polite and well-trained staff, comfortable rooms, reliable shuttle service and the peaceful haven our private island provides.  Next time you visit us, I would recommend the Authentic Venice class at our Sapori Cooking Academy â€“ it is such an unforgettable experience! The morning starts off with meeting Chef Micki and travelling together via private water taxi to the colorful Rialto Market. He helps you choose the freshest ingredients to take back to the resort where he teaches how to prepare delicious dishes following the Venetian culinary tradition. Plus you get to enjoy the lunch that you helped prepare. It is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the local culture.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
