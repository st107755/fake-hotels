Upon arrival and throughout our stay Luca and all the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The Kids Club was always busy with activities and the staff was very friendly and I felt like they genuinly cared about the kids!  There was a shuttle that went to Piazza San Marco every 30min and was always on time.  There are plenty of extra amenities that you can do... we had a great time at the Wine Tasting w/Simone, he was very informative and made the tasting fun and entertaining!.  The Spa was amazing!  The Sapori Cooking Academy was fun for the whole family (small kids included).  The food was amazing!  My family really enjoyed staying at JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa and would definitely recommend it to all our friends.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 10, 2017Dear nesalynn, thank you for taking the time to write a review. We are grateful for your generous comments about our friendly and helpful staff, fun Kids Club, convenient shuttle service, amazing spa and delicious food.  We hope you and your family had the chance to explore our private island by bicycle. One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with family, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
