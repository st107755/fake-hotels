My family of five (wife and three college aged girls) stayed here for three nights at the front end of an eight night vacation (the other five were in Rome). The hotel rooms were immaculate, the grounds are beautiful, the staff is incredibly polite and helpful, and everything runs on schedule (in particular, the ferry to/from St. Mark's Square - you could set your watch to it). The only hiccup we had was with the private water taxi from the airport - there must have been some confusion as the company called Blitz did not meet us outside of security and it took multiple phone calls and stops at a few desks to get on our way (all in all, an hour or so of frustration).

We appreciate your kind comments about our immaculate rooms, beautiful grounds and helpful staff.  We hope you and your family had the chance to explore our private island by bicycle. One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with friends, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
