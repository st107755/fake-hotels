We spent a super day on the Authentic Venice course with Chef Micki at the Cooking Academy. The day started with a trip to the Rialto Market, and finished with a sumptuous Meal in the School, having had a wonderful Morning cooking the produce we bought with our personable host Chef who came up with some brilliant recipes for the amazing Fish and Vegetables in our basket. If you have any interest in Food or Cooking it is an experience worth trying.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 30, 2016Dear robinhumber, thanks so much for your review.
