We stayed at the Marriott for a short Easter weekend break and found it to be a beautiful hotel and well worth the stay. as its located on its own little island we needed to use the complimentary shuttle service (boat) to San Marco square each day, this was a great service running every 30 minutes from 8am until 11pm. the hotel was quiet, beautiful and gave us great service. We would stay here again when we next visit Venice. the hotel has a fab roof top bar with brilliant views.  we arranged a taxi (boat) from the airport directly to the hotel which was no hassle at all. the only reason I didn't give them a 5* rating was the breakfast, it was good with lots of choice but at 30 euros each was a bit expensive for what it was.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare
