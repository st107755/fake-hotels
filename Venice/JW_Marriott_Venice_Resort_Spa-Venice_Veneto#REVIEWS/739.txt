To start with, treat yourself to a private water taxi to this hotel - the James Bond style entrance to the hotel by boat is out of this world!  We stayed here for 5 nights and we chose a La Residenza Deluxe room and it was worth every penny. Our room was so peaceful and the private outside space was heavenly. The rooms are near the spa and the gym - and you have a private concierge team which is also very helpful.

We are grateful for your generous comments about our impressive James Bond style entrance, peaceful rooms, exceptional customer service, thoughtful activities and amazing spa facilities.  As you mentioned, we believe having the ability to escape Venice’s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit, our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
