From the moment we set foot onto the complimentary launch that sped us from St Mark's Square to the luxurious JW Marriott, the whole experience was sensational. The hotel had only just opened and you might have expected some hitches. Absolutely not! The ambience was superb, decor calm and contemporary and the room was spectacular. Great coffee machine, turn down service spot on and even free sweets in reception! Add to this the most amazing breakfast buffet and the rooftop infinity pool with views of the Venice skyline and this is a hotel to die for! The staff were friendly and helpful : the service first class. Not a thing was too much trouble. Our holiday in Venice was made extra special because we were staying in this wonderful hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 27, 2015Dear Madam,  How lovely it was to read your review of our JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa!
