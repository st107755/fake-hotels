We visited Rome, Florence and stayed here one night. The service from the minute you step off the boat until you leave is second to none. We ate at the roof top restaurant and our waiter, Giuseppe was one of the best I have ever had. We ate at a Michelin 1 star restaurant two days ago and the service Giuseppe gave was as good as the Michelin restaurant. He was personable, highly attentive and was mentoring and coaching the staff to deliver exceptional service. Great hotel, very relaxing and modern. Marc Mata also was attentive and provided good service as well. 10++++Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 5, 2017Dear Kelly B, thanks so much for your positive feedback.
