We are really sorry to hear that our property didn't match your expectations. It is unfortunate that after such a pleasant trip in Italy we couldn't deliver the service that you expected. We do apologize for the inconvenience with the AC. We have a team of engineers that is currently fixing the problem as we have still a very few rooms that are affected and for those we are providing a mobile AC unit that we understand is not ideal but certainly helps to mitigate the problem. We are really sorry to hear that you felt our staff being unfriendly. Our staff has been always very friendly also according to the other reviews and I think in good faith they have upgraded you not to "buy" your happiness but for making sure you would enjoyed your stay with us after a difficult start. Again we apologize for the other comments you made and we hope that a few positive aspects of your recent stay with us such as the beauty of the resort and our roof top infinity pool will encourage you to give us a second chance. We look forward to welcoming you again to the JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa.  Cristiano Cabutti Director of Sales & MarketingRead more
