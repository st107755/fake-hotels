Ah, Venezia! The JW Marriott is located a short ride from Venice and the Grand Canal on its own island, Isola delle Rose. We had adjoining suites in the rose gardens. The rooftop infinity pool overlooks the city, just have a spritz or some other refreshing cocktail and relax! First class all the way, you can't go wrong. We went in July 2015 and can't wait to go back!  Follow our fun on IG @travelwinefoodieRead moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
