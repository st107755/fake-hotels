From the minute we arrived, the staff couldn't do enough for you. Polite and helpful throughout the hotel. The rooms were lovely, clean, bright and spacious. With a balcony and distant view of Venice in the sunlight. As part of a large party of 40 we were treated to a private dinner on the rooftop terrace with excellent service and delicious food. The breakfast was plentiful and again service was quick and efficient. We had the wonderful experience of the joining chef Micky for a mornings pasta class and I can honestly say it was the best experience - laughter and prosecco throughout the morning and delicious pasta dishes at the end. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. It was fantastic!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 28, 2016Dear Dawn P, thanks so much for sharing your recent experience at our magical Isola delle Rose.
