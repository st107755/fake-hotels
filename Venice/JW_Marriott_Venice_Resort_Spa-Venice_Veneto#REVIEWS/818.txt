I have been to Venice over the weekend and decided to experience a stay in an island where your main way of transportation is a boat. JW Marriott was the choice! Although it was a low season for them but it was almost fhll. From the very first sight of the hotel we knew it will be a great one. When they wrote "we speak your language" they really meant it. In minimum, I heard them speaking 5 languages which is very useful. Luxurious rooms, comfy bed, friendly staff and great breakfast. Shuttle boats are available every half an hour to the main island. I would definitely recommend everyone to stay in this resort.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 2, 2016Dear Noor A, thanks for your review.
