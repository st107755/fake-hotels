The hotel itself is on a beautiful island. The downside to this is that you have to take a boat to and from Venice, but the ride itself is not bad. Service was fantastic, though food was subpar and extremely overpriced.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 11, 2017Dear pagm2017, thank you for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our amazing service and beautiful island.  Our Isola delle Rose – Island of Roses – has a rich history. Its position, halfway between the lagoon and sea, has given the island a special microclimate, which has encouraged the growth of plants and trees rare in Venice and inspired the establishment of a clinic of respiratory ailments at the beginning of the 20th century. We are proud of the historical roots of our private island and love to share the beauty of our grounds with our guests.  Thanks for choosing the JW Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
