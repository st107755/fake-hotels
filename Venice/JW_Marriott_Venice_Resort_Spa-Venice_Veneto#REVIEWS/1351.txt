We ve always dreamed of coming to Venice... But this city is a total rip off! Get prepared to pay horrendous amounts on watertaxi - even on public transportation. For tourists everything costs 5x more than for residents.  At the Marriott prepare yourself for unfriendly, unavailable and arrogant staff. Not at all 5* hotel like!   It is not possible to take a water taxi below 80€, even if the trip only takes 5min to the next island...   The deluxe rooms are a joke! The bathroom s are 2* standard. Lights not working etc.  To access the spa you need to pay an extra 25€. A cappuccino costs 7€.  Breakfast buffet adapted to mass tourism, bad bread, worst eggs... And cantina ambiance.  Get ready to pay extra for every step you make in this city!  Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
