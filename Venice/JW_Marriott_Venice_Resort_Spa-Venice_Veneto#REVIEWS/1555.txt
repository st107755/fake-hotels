We have just returned from the jw Marriott hotel and my first impression of the lobby was just wow.  We found all staff pleasant helpful and very attentive. I actually lost something which got mixed up with laundry and they went out if there way to find it and I actually got it back amazingly they couldn't do anything more so I find the staff faultless.  We were given drinks on arrival and kindly given a guided tour of hotel before been personally shown around out junior suite which was stylish and immaculate and very spacious. One of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in and ladies the wardrobe is massive its like a small room !!! If only I could take it home ha!  What's lovely about this hotel is that it meant out first trio to venice was not just a city break we could Sunbatheâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
