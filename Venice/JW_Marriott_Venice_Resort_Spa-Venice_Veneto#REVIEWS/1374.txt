If you want a new and beautiful hotel in venice without moldy rooms this is the place. Bathrooms are beautiful and modern. Only problem is no outlet to plug in hair dryer in bathroom. Must do in room and hard to see mirror but did not matter. Would stay again. About a 15 min boat ride to st Marco square. Great breakfast buffet everyday. Very particular and loved hotel!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 21, 2015Dear Rhonda,  We would like to thank you for your feedback.
