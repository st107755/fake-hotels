We recently stayed at the property from August 20th to the 23rd, 2016. The JW Venice is a beautiful property to stay at with the family. I have three children ages 15, 13 and 10. They all enjoyed staying here. Its a new and modern property that maintains the old world charm with the older architecture and brickwork. Décor was modern. I loved the walnut tables in our room.  We stayed in the outer buildings closer to the pool.   The staff was always smiling, friendly and available to meet all our needs. Service was not lacking in any way. It was definitely a 5 star resort in that regard. At the pool the staff was always ready with towels and helpful to open the umbrellas for shade. They were also sweet to provide complimentary cool down refreshments by the pool for those feeling…Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 29, 2016Dear goodtimetravels, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful property, modern décor, friendly staff and nice views.  We are delighted to hear that you and your family enjoyed the peaceful oasis that our resort provides after a full day exploring Venice. Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as an amazing Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
