We go to Venice every 2 years for the art Biennale, this year for the first time in summer. We therefore decided to stay in this marvelous resort for the facilities (swimming pools and Spa). It was really very good and the staff was very friendly, specially Nina and Giannpiero made our stay special serving us breakfast. There is also a very good one star Michelin Restaurant (Doppolavoro) which exceeded our expectations!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 23, 2017Dear Renata F, thanks for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our marvellous resort, nice facilities, friendly staff and delicious food.  I am also delighted that you enjoyed your dining experience at Dopolavoro. Our Executive Chef, Federico Belluco is an impressive person. He is a perfectionist and works everyday for at least 14 hours. Even on his day off he loves to experience and develop our culinary offering. When the resort is closed for the winter, Federico travels the world to find inspiration. We are very proud of all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes.  Thanks for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.
