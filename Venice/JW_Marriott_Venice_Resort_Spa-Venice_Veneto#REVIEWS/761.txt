We are delighted that you enjoyed your experiences at Dopolavoro and our GOCO Spa.  Our resort is a culinary destination in Venice – only six months after its opening, Dopolavoro obtained its first Michelin star under the leadership of one of Italy’s most celebrated chefs, Giancarlo Perbellini and his team. What is offered is a traditional but unique gastronomic dining experience. The restaurant is surrounded by our organic botanical gardens, which not only provide guests with a beautiful setting, but also a wide variety of produce that we use in our dishes. It is a luxury dining experience that is not to be missed.   Thank you for choosing to stay at our magical Isola delle Rose and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
