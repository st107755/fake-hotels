The JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa is a pleasant getaway when visiting Venice. The resort is located on its own island a short boat ride from St. Marks Square. The pool and poolside service are terrific.  Make sure you visit the rooftop restaurant  with beautiful views of the city on your trip and if you can request Bogdan  to receive impeccable service while enjoying the delicious food. Truly a wonderful experience!Read moreDate of stay: June 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
