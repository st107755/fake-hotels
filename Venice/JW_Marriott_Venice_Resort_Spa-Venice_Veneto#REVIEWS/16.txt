We stayed at the JW Marriot during half-term and we can't wait to go back!.  We enjoyed biking in the private island, walking around not to mention our heated plunge pool in our lovely room yard. Our 5 year old son was very well taken care of by all personnel and he just loved being there. Spa was also a great experience. Highly recommended for families as connection to the city with the boats is lots of fun!Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
