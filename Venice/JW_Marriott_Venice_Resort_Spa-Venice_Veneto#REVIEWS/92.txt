Most incredible experience. Was so worth not staying in Venice and having the peace and quiet of the island. Every staff member greeted us warmly, the shuttle was prompt and easy and only took about 20 minute to Venice from the island. Grounds are immaculate and because of the beauty of the island we got engaged on the property.  Cant recommend staying here enough. My only regret is we didn't try the restaurants but had drinks on the rooftop which was lovely!Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
