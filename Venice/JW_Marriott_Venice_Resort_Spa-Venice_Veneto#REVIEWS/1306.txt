Hotel is located on a small island in the Venice Lagoon about 15 mins by boat (provided by the hotel) to the landing adjacent to St Marks Square. I think the island had been used for an isolation hospital, happily no longer required, so there is a mix of new & renovated buildings including a church all forming part of the hotel complex. The view from the infinity pool across the lagoon to St Marks is sensational & there is space for a quiet walk around the island if the hustle & bustle of Venice becomes too much. The rooms are up to Marriott standard & there are several restaurants, the food is good but pricey. The upmarket restaurant isn't easy to locate as it is in a separate building some distance from the main hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Mar 20, 2016Dear CEJ2013, thank you so much for your positive review. We really appreciate your kind comments about our remarkable location and sensational views. As you mentioned, our Isola delle Rose – Island of Roses – has a rich history. Its position, halfway between the lagoon and sea, has given the island a special microclimate, which has encouraged the growth of plants and trees rare in Venice and inspired the establishment of a clinic of respiratory ailments at the beginning of the 20th century. We are proud of the historical roots of our private island and love to share the beauty of our grounds with our guests.  Thanks for choosing the JW Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
