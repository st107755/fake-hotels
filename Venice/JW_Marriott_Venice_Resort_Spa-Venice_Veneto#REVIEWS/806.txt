We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful and calm island, impeccable customer service, beautiful grounds and breathtaking views.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our property provides the perfect respite.

Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
