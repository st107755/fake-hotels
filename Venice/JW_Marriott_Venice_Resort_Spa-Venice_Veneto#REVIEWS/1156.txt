This hotel surpassed all expectations. The breakfast buffet is well managed and the choice of food extensive. Cocktails and snacks at the roof bar for sunset were very special. The boat trip to and from St Marks Square is regular and a pleasant short hop. The Spa is worthwhile visiting although an extra charge. Don't forget to take a walk around the island and check out the family pool located away from the main building. After the hustle and bustle of Venice during the day its a great place to retire back to away from it all. The staff really couldn't do enough to help.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 1, 2016Dear Templeq1, thanks so much for your review.
