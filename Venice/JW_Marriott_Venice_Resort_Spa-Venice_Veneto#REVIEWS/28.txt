As we arrived in Venezia, we located the shuttle boat. The shuttle boat was a nice experience. The boat was clean, comfortable and equipped with plush leather seats. As we exited the shuttle onto the island we were greeted by bell man Sasha, he was courteous and welcoming with offering luggage assistance. The Front Desk agent Claudia was genuine and caring in conversation. She was patient in explaining the amenities of the hotel - we felt we knew everything after! Our room was spotless, with our own personal outdoor garden. A tip, as you open your hotel room door there is a white wall just next to the door hinges of the entry door - it is a closet! Inside are extra pillows and iron/ironing board. Special thank you to Angelo Vignola for the accommodations prior to arrival! Read moreDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
