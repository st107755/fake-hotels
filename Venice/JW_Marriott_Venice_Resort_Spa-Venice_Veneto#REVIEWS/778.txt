Visited for a one night stay for my wife's birthday and what more to say than wow! Our James Bond style water taxi arrival (which absolutely has to be done) was amazing and set the scene for what was a lovely stay. Tucked away on its own little island the staff were fantastic and couldn't have been more helpful and attentive. From the check in, to drinks and a snack in the lobby and dinning in the evening all the staff made out stay wonderful.  The free shuttle service to the mainland was great and coming back after a long day of site seeing, shopping and eating was a nice way to see the lights of the city over the waters. Will definitely stay here on any return to Venice, Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jan 26, 2017Dear RuudiAG, thanks for your glowing feedback.
