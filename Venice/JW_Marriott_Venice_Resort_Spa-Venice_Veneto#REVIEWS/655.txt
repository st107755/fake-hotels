What a wonderful place to stay for a complete rest - it is located on an island just out of Venice and we are so glad we stayed there instead of in Venice itself. The Marriott runs regular free shuttles  to and from the island every half hour. Venice gets very busy and going back to the island is wonderful. Staff are very friendly and try really hard with their English but is a little hard for them at times . The only issue we had was the breakfast staff could do with some training as on two consecutive days we had the staff serve cold coffee and tea and also happened with room service. Food was not as a higher standard as would expect but that may be a culture thing . Avoid those issues and eat in Venice as so many choices.

We appreciate your generous comments about our friendly staff and relaxing atmosphere.  We believe having the ability to escape Veniceâ€™s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit, our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
