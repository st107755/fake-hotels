We stayed here 5 night and loved every minute. The staff here is so friendly and goes above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. Smiles and a kind greeting always We did the private water taxi from the airport into the hotel lobby for the James Bond Experience and it was so fun. It was pricey but worth it.  The room was very nice and the grounds are amazing. We loved the peace of the property after busy days in Venice.  I have seen other reviews that said the boat only ran hourly but that was NOT the case. The Marriott boat was always very timely and available every half hour both ways. It worked out great.  I think the best part of the resort is the rooftop pool, restaurant and bar. It is beautiful.  Things are expensive but this is a private island so we were not surprised.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
