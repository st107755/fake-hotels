Very nice hotel. Mostly great staff. Pricey, but that was expected. Only small moan was guy running boat service (Giovanni). Boat every 30 minutes. Our group arrived early for 11pm boat back to hotel but he allowed a large group of 15 to go to front of queue. That meant approximately same amount of people were left to wait for next boat. Was obviously worth his while ðŸ˜‰ Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Front Office Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 11, 2019Dear PigeonCraig,  thank you for sharing your valued feedback about your recent stay at our JW Marriott Venice. We are truly glad to read that you appreciated the property and the Staff service extended.  We regret to acknowledge that you had to wait for the next boat to embark due to the large presence of guests at that specific timing. This is the reason why, during most of the season, we grant our complimentary shuttle service every thirty minutes instead of every hour, to ensure a smooth transportation service to all our guests.  We will continue to monitor the service and to request, when needed, additional water taxis to limit the amount of waiting time.  We take the opportunity to thank you for having chosen us for your Venetian stay, and we hope to welcoming you back in the nearest future.  Kindest regards,  Erica Travan Front Office Manager Erica.travan@jwmarriotthotels.comRead more
