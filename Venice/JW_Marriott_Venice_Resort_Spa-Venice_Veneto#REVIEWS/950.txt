Stayed for two days, beautiful entrance and very new rooms. I would highly suggest the chic-nic for lunch where Corina arranged the most lovely of picnics in a secluded area of the park. The roof top is also perfect for viewing sunset at night.

We appreciate your positive feedback about our fantastic hotel, beautiful entrance and new rooms.  I am also delighted to hear that you enjoyed spending the spectacular views from our rooptop pool and restaurant, Sagra. You might be interested to hear that besides the regular menu, we also offer a special menu from the Cicchetti Bar, which are Venetian-style tapas. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden. One of my favorite dining experiences is enjoying these Venetian-style tapas while overlooking the dramatic skyline of the Lagoon during sunset at our rooftop.   Thank you for choosing to stay at our magical Isola delle Rose and we hope to welcome you back again very soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
