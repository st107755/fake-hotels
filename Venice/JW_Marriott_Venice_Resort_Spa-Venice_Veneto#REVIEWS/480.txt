This has to be one of the best hotels in Venice. On an Island of it's own, about 20 mins boat ride from San Marco Square the hotel is modern, cool, light and has as a bonus a couple of swimming pools, an adult only one on the roof top with stunning views across Venice, and with a bar and restaurant there too.  The breakfast buffet was very good and so was the food from the restaurants.  I thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel and would definitely return and recommend this hotel for a trip to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 11, 2017Dear julesbirdie, thanks for your review. We are thrilled to hear you say that our property is one of the best hotels in Venice. We appreciate your kind comments about our stunning views and good food.  You might be interested to hear that besides the regular menu at our rooftop restaurant Sagra, we also offer a special menu from the Cicchetti Bar, which are Venetian-style tapas. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden. One of my favorite dining experiences is enjoying these Venetian-style tapas while overlooking the dramatic skyline of the Lagoon during sunset at our rooftop.   Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
