Stayed at this resort for 2 wonderful nights.  The staff were all wonderful, especially Francesca at the front desk.  She had a microwave delivered to our room so we could heat up our pasta...Fantastic!!!  Oh and the resort is beautiful, frequent complimentary boats every half hour into Venice, lovely breakfast buffet, and quiet island which acts as a sanctuary from the overcrowded touristy island of Venice~Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 13, 2016Dear David C, thanks so much for your review. We really appreciate your kind comments about our top-notch customer service, wonderful staff, beautiful resort and lovely breakfast.  I agree, what we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to Venice means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope you visit us again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
