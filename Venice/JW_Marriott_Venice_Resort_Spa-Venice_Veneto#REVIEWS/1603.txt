Beautiful new hotel, just opened for a few months and most of the kinks were worked out. Great place for a business conference or a wedding as the hotel sits on its own island 15 minutes from Venice by Vaporetto (water shuttle), though shuttle available  every 15-30 minutes. Unfortunately, we felt it was too isolated if spending time exploring the streets (and canals) is critical for you. Not really interested in walking the beautiful grounds when Venice is your attraction.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 29, 2015Dear Ronn,  We would like to thank you for your review; we are sorry to read you felt isolated as - as staten also by several Tripadvisor reviewers - we offer a complimentary shuttle service running on a frequent basis from and to St. Mark's Square.
