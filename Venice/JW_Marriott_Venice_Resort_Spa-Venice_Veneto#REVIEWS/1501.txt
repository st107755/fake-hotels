The hotel is in a great setting but as of now is still "work in progress". There are a number of bugs/issues around the hotel that compromise what should be an enjoyable and relaxing stay. In no particular order: the air conditioning in the bedroom and common areas is inadequate, in the bathroom, the overhead shower appears to have very little pressure - it's like standing in a light drizzle when you want a full blown rain storm, the pillows in the bedroom have an unpleasant smell to them, there are not enough sun beds around the 2 pools for a hotel of this size, breakfast can easily feel like a scrum with too many people chasing too few tables. The hotel staff are trying but it doesn't have the charm you want from a 5 star hotel in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 24, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for taking the time to write your feedback about our property and for sharing your impressions with us.
