As this hotel is located on its own island you need a water taxi to get there. The hotel runs a scheduled free taxi for guests or you can choose a private water taxi and it costs around 70 Euros. It took us around 30 mins on the water taxi from the stop nearest Garage San Marco where we parked. The people at the garaged arranged the private water taxi for us.   Checking in was great, its next to the bar so we grabbed a drink while we went through the check in process.   We were upgraded to a La Residenza Pool Suite due to my Marriott membership level and it was super impressive.   As its located quite a way away from the main building one of the bell boys will load up you luggage and take you to your room on a buggy! This is great as he takes you around the whole estate / islandâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
