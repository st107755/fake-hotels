my wife and I visited last week for 3 nights and I have to say the hotel in general was beautiful. felt like they were a bit short staffed in certain areas (especially at breakfast) which was delicious with lots of options. pool is beautiful albeit small and you need to get up early if you plan to spend a day around it. customer service on front desk needs a bit of work with some of the staff but as in the title, its early days for the hotel and you always expect a few teething problems.....Rome wasn't built in a day :-)  the shuttle service is fantastic and the concierge also were great with recommendations and any bookings being either restaurants or water taxi`s. would definitely go back in the futureRead moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 2, 2015Dear Simon,  We would like to thank you for your detailed feedback.
