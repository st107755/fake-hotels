Checked in with my husband and two teenagers.  Chill vibe felt from the moment you approach the property slowly on the boat with fantastic ambient background music.  Met by the team of Michael, Manuel, Massimo, Valentino and Omar.  Driven on golf cart to the reception building.  Professional, enthusiastic, and efficient warm reception during check in led by Gianmarco.  Stood out from the beginning and throughout our interaction during our week long stay.  Gianmarco, Pep, Giulia and Federica were always at the ready to assist, research and overall facilitate any needs during our stay.  Superior on all levels.  Our spacious, modern accomodations were a loft townhouse concept!  Great design concept.  Kudos to JW Marriott on the interiors and grounds.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
