JW marriott is such an amazing property in venice. To reach the property you have to go by a private boat. Shuttle service is available till marco polo. They have an open pool at the top from where you can see whole venice. Amazing. They have another family pool too. Amazing breakfast. You can enjoy sitting at the poolside. Enjoy drinks and the view, very friendly staff. And special thanks to executive chef who made indian food for us. Will definately visit again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 20, 2016Dear Nikita8612, thank you for taking the time to write a review. We are really grateful for your kind comments about our amazing property, beautiful pools, amazing breakfast and friendly staff.  We hope that you had the chance to sample the delicious cuisine at our Sagra Rooftop restaurant. Besides the regular menu, we also offer a special menu from the Cicchetti Bar, which are Venetian-style tapas. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden. One of my favorite dining experiences is enjoying these Venetian-style tapas while overlooking the dramatic skyline of the Lagoon during sunset at our rooftop.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
