It’s an island on its own has a Michelin starred restaurant  and: a rooftop bar and pool with absolutely amazing sunset views, a separate family pool and play areas for kids, an elegant separate lounge and a full spa. We stayed in a suite which had its own private garden and plunge pool. Frequent free water taxi service to the heart of Venice and we payed for a water taxi pick up at the airport. Dined at the restaurant and it was simply the best meal I’ve ever had with all the herbs and fresh produce grown on the island.Read moreDate of stay: September 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
