No doubt hotel is perfectly located if you like to escape from the hustle and bustle of Venice. Shuttle boats are working perfectly. Staff is trained to be very friendly and they are. All in all we had a wonderful time.   However some of the standards Marriott is maintaining you won't find. I was trying to chat regrading our transport from airport to hotel but there was no response. I called them and later I sent an email. No response. An apology on arrival and a promise to look into but nothing happened. I'm Platinum Premier. There was no status recognition at all. And finally late check out was almost denied. And the promised response on not given 20% F&B discount again never arrived.
