We are a family of 5 (3 teens) and we loved this place!  It was very very pricey to eat and drink but worth every penny!   It sits on its own island across the water from San Marco square- about 20 minutes by private JW Marriott boat.  We booked two rooms- had our own wing!  The service was the best we had in all of Italy.  The family pool was a nice walk from the main hotel next to a field of sunflowers and gardens.  There’s a beautiful adult pool on the roof.  The gym was impeccable as well.  From the moment you step foot into this hotel, you feel relaxed and welcomed!  I’m a Marriott member and am very glad we picked this place for our stay in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
