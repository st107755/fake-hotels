This is a newer property on its own 40 acre island in Venice lagoon.  And it's almost a shame that you have to leave to see the rest of Venice.  Very nice rooms, a wonderful breakfast buffet, infinity pool on the roof with the skyline of Venice in the background, nice artwork all over, a great spa, private boat service right to San Marco.  And did I mention on its own island. And excellent service - attentive but not overbearing, professional without being stuffy and everyone very friendly and genuinely nice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 2, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for your feedback on your recent stay!
