This is a beautiful resort in Italy!  We arrived via water taxi from the airport and the taxi goes right into the lobby of the hotel.  A very nice way to be introduced to this beautiful hotel.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, our room was spotless and very well appointed.  The pools, restaurants and spa are not to be missed. A superb experience!

We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful resort, nice arrival experience, friendly and helpful staff, well-appointed rooms and amazing facilities.  We are so proud of the beautiful design of our 19 buildings on our private island, which are the work of the renowned Italian architect Matteo Thun. His main focus was to integrate the contemporary elements of the existing buildings to showcase their unique history and personality, while at the same time enhancing the architectural heritage of our location.  Thank you for choosing to stay at the JW Marriott Venice and we look forward to welcoming you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
