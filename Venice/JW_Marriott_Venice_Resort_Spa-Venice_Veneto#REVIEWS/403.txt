So, visually, the place is kind of neat sitting off on its own island with the James Bond entrance.  Great pool on roof.  Nice rooms. You can pay 39 euro for a resort package that allows you to use resort's bicycles.  Wow!!  Is there anyplace to ride?  NO..  For a location in a place like Venice, it was a little to antiseptic, a little too bland.  Stamped out of the Marriott mold. The waitress suggested a wine that I went with.  It turned out to be a low end Antinori that you find on sale everywhere throughout the U.S.  Here I am within a stones throw of fantastic wine growing areas and estates and they give me a widely available mass market and unfortunately disappointing wine.  There was only 7 or 8 wines on the list.
