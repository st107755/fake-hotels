When we arrived it was prime check in time but no one was at the Elite desk to help us. The balconies in the suite had thousands of dead flies but the staff promptly cleaned it. We eat in one night and the waiter fought with me over an item he accidentally brought out and wanted to charge me for. Other than those issue we enjoyed our stay. The property was amazing with lots of privacy and frequent shuttles to Venice which were fun. The SPA was amazing as the services were awesome and the private pool was relaxing. We had room service and the gentleman was awesome setting everything up and confirming if we needed anything else. Also, we used the concierge to confirm our hotel in Lake Como since we never got an email and he was glad to reach out to them and help.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 21, 2015Dear John Paul,  Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor.
