The location is amazing and got its athmosphere as it is located on island. Yes you need to go by boat to reach St.Marco but in Venice you need to use boats anyway :). Hotel got its own shuttle to St.Marco square every 30 minutes. There are rooms/suits with beautiful 60m2 terrace or mezonet apartments with private(small) pool in your private garden accompanied with sea view. Food was excellent , I recommend the restaurant on top of the roof of the main building with view over the whole island and venice. Island offer nice parks, sports activities etc It was great stay and I would love to come back one dayRead moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 19, 2016Dear Cluedo87, thanks for your positive feedback. We are grateful for your kind comments about our amazing location, beautiful rooms, excellent food and our fun activity program.  Next time you visit us, you should check out our Squero Tramontin tour to see how gondolas are made. This exclusive excursion via water taxi takes JW guests to the magical and authentic place where gondolas are built and repaired. It is an excursion that I highly recommend to our guests â€“ there is only one place like this in Venice.  Thank you for choosing to stay at our Isola delle Rose and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
