This Spa is very good with outstanding and views of Venice and a tranquil atmosphere. I had the full body aromatherapy massage with Erika, I must admit this is one of the best massages I’ve had so far, making me feel extremely relaxed afterwards. Erika recommended a good product for my hands as I suffer from dry skin and this seemed affordable and hope it will be beneficial? I would definitely like to recommend this Spa and hotel to other people thinking of staying here, enjoy!

We appreciate your generous comments about our spa’s outstanding views and tranquil atmosphere.  As you mentioned, our spa is such a wonderful experience and you can spend the whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
