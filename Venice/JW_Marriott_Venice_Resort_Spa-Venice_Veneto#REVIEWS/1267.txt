Had a pleasant stay at the hotel.  Beautiful grounds and excellent service from all during our stay.  We tried the Sapori Cooking School with Chef Micki on Friday night with our two boys ages 6 &10.  They had an absolute blast and liked it so much we did another class the following evening. Truly an unforgettable experience for our family.  Will be going back this summer again!Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 7, 2016Dear ExpatMike1, thank you for taking the time to write a review.
