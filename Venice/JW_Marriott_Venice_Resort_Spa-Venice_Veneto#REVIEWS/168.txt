I can not say enough great things about this Marriott property.  From the moment you pull up to what is called “the James Bond entrance” you are greeted with smiles and 5 star service.   The staff is helpful, personable, and always at your service.  We enjoyed two of the cooking classes, the pasta and pizza. Chef Luigi was wonderful and super funny, and full of knowledge. We enjoyed a spa pass for our first day to rest off the jet-lag which was nice.  The view from our room provided us great daytime and nighttime views of Venice and the boats passing by.  Do yourself a favor and go to the 4th floor corner to watch the sunrise. I am already planning my return stay. Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
