This incredible Marriott is located on its own private island. It has its own launch that goes directly from a pier, located right in front of St. Marks Square.  The shuttle runs every 30 minutes.  The launch itself is wood trimmed and very plush. It was enjoyable just watching the river traffic each time we went to and from the hotel to St. Mark's Square. Because of location, Unlike the rest of Venice, it is exceptionally quiet. Because there was a  small business meeting during our stay, we were upgraded from the main hotel to a separate building: a two-story loft that was very glamorous. The loft had two bathrooms, a large living room, and itâ€™s own splash pool.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 4, 2016Dear lawton1osuedu, thanks for writing a review. We appreciate your kind comments about our incredible hotel, quiet location and beautiful rooms.  Did you have the chance to explore our private island by bicycle? One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with friends, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General ManagerRead more
