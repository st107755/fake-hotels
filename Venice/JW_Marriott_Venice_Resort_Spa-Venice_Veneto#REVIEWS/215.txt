Great family resort.  This was the latter end of our trip and it was  good way to end it.  I enjoyed being away from he hustle and bustle of Venice.  We didn't find the boat ride to be bad at all.  It came on time, every half hour.  Our accommodations was very roomy.  We booked the residences, since we are a family of four.  Our kids were able to roam the property freely, swim, ride bikes, and eat gelato.  The only thing was that the restaurants seemed to always be booked.  So book your reservations early.  We stayed flexible and found it just as fun to go into venice, explore the canals, and eat like the locals.  Overall, we loved the resort and can't wait to go back.  Make sure you find time to go to the rooftop pool.  The view is soooo romantic and absolutely breathtaking.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
