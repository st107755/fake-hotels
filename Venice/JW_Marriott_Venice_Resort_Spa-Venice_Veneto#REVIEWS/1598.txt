The resort has its own island but the shuttle runs frequently enough back and forth to San Marco Piazza to make it easily accessible. The resort is pristine. It has a well equipped workout room, several areas to dine in, a more-than-generous breakfast, and a beautiful pool area. You could vacation here even if you never left the island but obviously Venice is made to be well traveled from one side to the other on foot!!  The staff is very helpful and the service is stellar.  I LOVE that apples are offered and waters, coffees and chocolates are shared!  I would highly recommend this resort!
