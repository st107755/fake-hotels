Visited in June on a girl's trip and later in Oct with husband who has a lifetime status with the Marriott brand.  Offered an upgrade for 60 euros that included breakfast.  We declined and were presented a room on the first floor without a view but with a huge terrace.  No tub, 2 free waters/coffee/tea, robes/slippers, nice toiletries, ironing board, snacks/drinks for $.     Service is great...check in, house keeping, facilities but did not eat at the property this time. The hotel is a good choice for a couple of days; however, I have to agree with other posters that the water taxi gets old.  Friends stayed at the Autograph brand during our stay and received breakfast/upgrades/perks so we will stay there next time.

We appreciate your kind words about our great service.  Our property is unique in the sense that it is located on its own private island, which is only a short boat ride away from San Marco Square. Many of our guests tell us that they really enjoy the combination of accessibility to Venice and peace and seclusion that our hotel offers after a full day of sightseeing. Being able to provide this oasis of calm is what makes us special and why many of our guests who are frequent visitors of Venice decide to stay with us time and time again.  Thank you for choosing to stay with us and we hope that we can welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again in the future.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General ManagerRead more
