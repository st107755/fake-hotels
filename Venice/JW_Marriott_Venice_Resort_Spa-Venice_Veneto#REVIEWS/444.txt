An amazing upgrade helped, but this place is truly amazing!  It's a great place to visit Venice because you're close to the action, but it's an oasis out in the Lagoon (best to visit the City before 11 and/or after 7 to avoid the crowds).  Prices here are high, but quality is very good (probably the best pizza I've ever had is served in the Rose Bar) and the staff are uniformly helpful and pleasant (special shout out to Turgut and Franco).Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 2, 2017Dear Todd K, thanks for your wonderful feedback.
