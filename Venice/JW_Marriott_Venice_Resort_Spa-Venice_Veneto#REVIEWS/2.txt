This was exactly what we wanted: A James-Bond style entrance on our own boat into the Boat-House; someone to carry our luggage. Much better, in my opinion, than trying to haul your own luggage through the maze of carless streets in Venice proper. We were a quick 10 minute boat ride from St. Mark's square, and yet when we needed a relaxing afternoon at the pool or a gourmet meal, it was just steps away from our beautiful room. The meals are pricey, granted, since you literally have no food options except at the hotel. But we planned for that, and even enjoyed a Michelin 3 star meal at Dopolovoro. Plan ahead and you'll love it!Read moreDate of stay: July 2019LocationServiceSleep QualityRoom Tip: Can't go wrong; every view is fantastic; every inch is quietSee more room tipsHelpfulShare
