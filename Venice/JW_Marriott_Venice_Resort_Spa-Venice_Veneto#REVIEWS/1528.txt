The resort had all the potential to deliver a unique experience but fell very short. A beautiful room but had none of the required basics, only hand held shower unable to stand and take shower, no facility to dry hair with a mirror to hand, poor turn down service, no balcony furniture. Breakfast ranged from poor to excellent dependant on team on duty. It felt that everything was hit or miss. Check in and out was poor and failed on every point. Really disappointed especially as it was my gift to my husband for his 60th I am fairly easy going but this did not live up to expectations the finer detail expected at a high end result was not delivered consistently.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
