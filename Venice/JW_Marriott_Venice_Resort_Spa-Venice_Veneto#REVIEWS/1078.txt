We could not fault this resort, it is amazing!  When Venice got too busy it was so lovely to be able to escape to the peace and quiet of a private island. The buffet breakfast has a fantastic choice and even set my husband up for a full day of sightseeing! The view from the rooftop pool is stunning, but the other pool is equally as nice and nothing like as busy.  The shuttle service is so good that it's very easy to pop back into Venice when the crowds have died down.  All in all I cannot recommend this resort highly enough and although we feel that we have 'done' Venice, that would not stop us going back just to stay here.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 3, 2016Dear Martyjb, thank you so much for your review. We are grateful for your generous comments about our amazing resort, fantastic breakfast buffet, stunning views and convenient shuttle service.  I agree, I think our private island is an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort. Some guests even tell us that on some days they donâ€™t leave our island!  Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
