We had the BEST stay at this hotel and give it our highest recommendation.  It is VERY close and convenient to the city center, but so quiet and peaceful and relaxing!  They offer a free shuttle back and forth so it's very easy to see everything you'd like to see.  Once you are in the center of town amidst the huge crowds, you will be grateful to have this escape!  The grounds are beautiful -- the infinity pool on the fourth floor an absolute highlight!  Do not miss it!  We originally were booked at one of the Marriotts in town.  We stayed two nights and cancelled the rest of our reservation.  The service was atrocious, the rooms noisy, and there was a foul, moldy smell to our room.    We are so glad we made the change.  The service at the JW Marriott is absolutely top notch. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 19, 2016Dear A S, thank you for writing a review.
