Arrival by taxi is spectacular but the hotel style has little Italian flair and is rather bland. Quality of fittings varied and were not always top quality. No real soul. Feels too corporate / American but island location is interesting. You travel to Venice, you are not in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 5, 2016Dear Bearsboy611, thanks for your review. We appreciate your kind words about our spectacular arrival experience. However, we are very sorry to hear that there were aspects of your vacation experience that you felt warranted improvement.   At our Isola delle Rose, we pride ourselves in creating a unique identity that is completely our own. The reasons we stand out and why guests gravitate to our property are different to those who choose to stay in other iconic hotels in Venice. Our secluded and peaceful location is one of our strongest assets as well as our first-class facilities such as our GOCO Spa (the largest in Venice) and our Michelin-starred restaurant, Dopolavoro.   In addition, every decision we made when designing our resort experience and activity program supports our desire to deliver intuitive personal service in an authentic and crafted environment. For instance, our customers love the opportunity to taste our vegetables grown in our botanic gardens, sample our exclusive olive oil produced from our 100 olive trees or just spend the afternoon in our pools overlooking the dramatic views of Venice and the Lagoon while admiring the incomparable Italian sunset.   These one-of-a-kind experiences that we offer are completely different to what other hotels in Venice provide and we are very proud of this. Having said this, I am sorry to hear that you were unsatisfied with your stay but we hope that you will consider visiting us again in the future.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General ManagerRead more
