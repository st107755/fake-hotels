The JW Marriott Venice could not have been more beautiful! On its own private island, it provides a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of Venice. Our only regret was that we wished we had more time to spend at the resort! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful- from reception, to Corina at Dispensa and Gabriele- they were all very professional and went out of their way to make sure we had the best stay possible. I cannot say enough about this resort! We can't wait to come back to Venice to stay here.
