A beautiful hotel in an amazing setting. The grounds were wonderful with plenty of space to relax in. The infinity pool was lovely however the pool and steps are made of stainless steel and can be very slippery especially on entering the pool for the first time. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful however we had great difficulty in replenishing shower gel for the bathroom. The first three times we asked were given shampoo and conditioner so we ended up with multiple tubes of these but still no shower gel. Some of the house keeping staff did not appear to understand English very well so did not understand what we wanted.  The food was very good but we feel that if you wanted to dine there both at lunchtime and in the evening it would you would run up very large bills.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 23, 2016Dear Trevor113, thank you for taking the time to write a review.
