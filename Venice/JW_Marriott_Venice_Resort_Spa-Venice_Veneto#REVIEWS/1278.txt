We appreciate your kind feedback about our brand new hotel, lovely gardens, good breakfast and nice staff. I am also glad that you were able to spend time in our picturesque park and gardens. One of the fun activities that we offer guests is the opportunity to rent bikes (complimentary and included in the Resort package) for the day to explore our historical grounds. It really is a fun and memorable way to discover our Isola delle Rose.  The feedback of our guests is very valuable to us so we appreciate you sharing your experience with us. I am speaking to the team about the observations that you mentioned in your review and we are discussing how we can improve our offering.
