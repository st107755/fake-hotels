This is a spectacular place...we only stayed for a couple of nights but wish we could have stayed longer.  We stayed in a suite across the property from the main building.  Only a shout walk through the olive grove to the lobby however.  It was the nicest, classiest greeting that I've ever had when entering the hotel.  It is an exceptional "welcome' experience...While we loved being in Venice, we also liked heading back to our Marriott oasis at the end of the evening.  If you are loyal to Marriott, and don't know what to do with you points, then consider Venice and also this JW Marriott location.
