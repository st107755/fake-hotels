My wife and I spent a week at this property and we didn’t want to leave. This resort is located on an island about a 20 minutes boat ride away from St. Mark’s Square. Our room was very nice and the property is very beautiful. The staff is superb. No worries about getting to St. Mark’s because they have a very efficient boat service that leaves every 30 minutes. One of the best hotel experiences we have had. Strongly recommend this resort. Read moreDate of stay: July 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
