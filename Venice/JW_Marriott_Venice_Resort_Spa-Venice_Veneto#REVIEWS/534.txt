On it own island away from the crowds. Beautiful hotel with very modern rooms. Sit by the roof top pool with the view of Venice. Excellent staff and very helpful. The grounds are very well maintained. Enjoyed just walking the island.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 13, 2017Dear Rich S, thank you for your glowing review. We appreciate your kind comments about our outstanding location, beautiful hotel, modern rooms, excellent and helpful staff and well-maintained grounds.  We believe having the ability to escape Veniceâ€™s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit, our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
