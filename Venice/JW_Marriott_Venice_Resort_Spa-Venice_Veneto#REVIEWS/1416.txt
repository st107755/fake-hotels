I have just returned from JW Marriott hotel, Venice and had an amazing stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Venice. The service from the staff was excellent, location perfect for relaxing away from busy Venice. Shuttle boat to and from St Mark's was very regular. Breakfast was amazing, great choice. We stayed in a deluxe king room which was huge, nicely decorated, very comfortable and absolutely no noise from outside. The gardens surrounding the hotel were lovely too. View from the infinity pool couldn't have been better. We ate in the restaurant on the roof 3 times and the food was lovely, great cocktails too. Unfortunately ran out of time to visit the spa, but will definitely visit next time. Hope to return to this hotel very soon!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 7, 2015Dear Sir,  How lovely it was to read your review of our JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa!
