Stayed at the JW Venice for 4 nights. Absolutely fantastic property, service, and experience.   First of all, it is located on its own private island. About a 20 minute ride from S. Marc’s Square. Arrival from the airport or train station is by water taxi. That’s a great experience alone. You come in to a covered dock that serves as the entrance to the hotel. Personally I have never arrived at a hotel by boat before so I found it to be truly unique.   The property is beautiful, complete with their own olive grove and chapel. Rooms are large and well appointed.   Service was outstanding, JW service is always very good, but this property went the extra mile. Down to the bellman remembering my name every time he saw me on property and greeting me.   Absolutely stay at this property…Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
