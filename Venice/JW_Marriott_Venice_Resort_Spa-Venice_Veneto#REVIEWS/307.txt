This resort was absolutely amazing.  Although we only stayed 2 nights I could not have asked for more.  The staff was great.  Our room was fantastic and included a private patio.  They have a kitchen where you can take cooking classes.  I would highly suggest used the JW Marriott water taxi.  Her name was Francessca.Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
