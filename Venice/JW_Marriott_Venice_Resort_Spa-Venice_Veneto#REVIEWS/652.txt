Great service and outstanding employees.  Made us feel welcomed and personalized every interaction we had with the staff.  The service and food on the roof top was amazing.  The view of Venice with the sunset is even more amazing.  Too many great staff to mention but Giuseppe (can easily run the place!), Anna, Chiara and ..... stood out.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 16, 2017Dear kamal a, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate your generous comments about our great service, outstanding employees and amazing views.  I hope you had the chance to check out our GOCO Spa. It is such a wonderful experience and you can spend a whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
