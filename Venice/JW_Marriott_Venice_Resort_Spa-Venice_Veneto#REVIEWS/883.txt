We appreciate your kind comments about our professional and helpful staff, great location and beautiful views.  I think that Venice is an ideal location to establish a base for a tour of Italy. Our airport is the third biggest in the country with connections to almost every single cosmopolitan city in the world and direct flights to several cities in Europe. Furthermore, the train system can take you to Milan, Rome, Florence or even as south as Napoli.

All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
