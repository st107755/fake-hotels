I am thrilled to hear that you enjoyed our cooking class with Chef Micki. I will make sure to share all your kind words with him – he will be delighted to hear that he made such a lasting impression.  Were you able to dine at Dopolavoro during your stay with us? We always encourage guests to take the opportunity to check it out and not be daunted by the Michelin star experience. We offer guests the opportunity to choose the set menu as well as order from the a la carte menu. The Restaurant Manager, Simone, would be more than happy to advise you on the kind of culinary experience that is right for you – whether that be a seven course tasting menu or a bistro experience (appetizer, main and dessert); you will have an unforgettable five star meal.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
