It's hard to write a review because everything here is great.  It's expensive but worth the expense.  On a large private island, away from the Venetian crowds.  Excellent food especially the breakfast buffet and coffee shop.  Rooftop bar with view of Venice.  Complimentary boat rides to/from San Marco and to the train station upon departure.  Great staff.  Definitely would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
