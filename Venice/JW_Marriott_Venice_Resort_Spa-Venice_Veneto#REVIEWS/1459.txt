I'm a lifetime Marriott Platinum member after staying 750+ nights.  There are many things to love and a few important things to hate about this hotel.    ADVANTAGES - It's a beautiful as the web site photos suggest.   - Pulling into the grand entrance from your water taxi is memorable. - The roof pool is easily one of the prettiest pools I've ever seen.  Has a great view of the Venice skyline, too. - Most of the service is top notch. - Breakfast was included in our plan.  The buffet was very, very good. - The Marriott web site glosses over the fitness center.  That's a shame, it's extremely nice.  It's in a restored 100+ year old building with charming exposed brick, wood floors, and wood ceiling.  It has all of the equipment anyone would need for a great workout.

Although we have been experiencing some issues with the newly opened hotel, unfortunately this does happen in the opening and we can see daily improvements.  Improvements are fortunately often also due to our smiling staff's attitude.  We fortunately not only enjoy our job, but we are passionate in Hospitality and proud to represent the first JW property in Italy. Thank you for having appreciated and highlighted in your review that service is top notch.  Please kindly be assured that all your constructive observations have been shared within our Management Team, so to discuss together all points.   What you kindly indicated is under observations and we hope to have the chance to welcome you back to Venice and demonstrate that what you pointed out was a situation successfully solved.  We thank you again and remain with our sincerest regards,  Linda Bertoni Marketing & Communication ManagerRead more
