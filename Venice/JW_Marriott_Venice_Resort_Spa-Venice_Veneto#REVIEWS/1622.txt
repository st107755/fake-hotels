This should be an incredible new hotel. Indeed it could be an incredible new hotel but sadly it was beset by teething problems during our stay. No water to our room for over 12 hours (not what you need after walking round Venice) and no aircon for two days either.  The grounds were also quite scruffy and some of the facilities shut. Not what we expected. That said, the staff were fantastic and the hotel very kindly made up for the inconvenience. Worth going to but check that everything is up and running beforehand.

Although we have been experiencing some technical issues with the newly opened hotel, unfortunately this does happen in the opening and we can see daily improvements.  Please kindly note that the lack of water for some hours was unfortunately due to an issue related to the water company managing some areas of our town. We are sorry if this has somehow affected your first evening at our property but this situation was not unfortunately depending on us.  We are happy you appreciated our associates' attentiveness and service;  we strive to serve guests brilliantly, with the main goal to offer them truly memorable and personalized stays.    We wish to have the chance, in the future, to welcoming you back to Venice and demonstrate you that what you kindly pointed out is something pleasantly solved.  Again, thank you for sharing your feedback with us and best regards,  Linda Bertoni Marketing & Communication ManagerRead more
