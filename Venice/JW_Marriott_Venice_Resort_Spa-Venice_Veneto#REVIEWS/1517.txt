Secluded on its own island, a short 20 minute boat ride to San Marco, this brand new resort delivers an excellent resort experience.   The shuttle runs back and forth every 15-30 minutes and was quite pleasant.   We had a well appointed corner room, spacious (more like American standards than Europe) and well appointed.   The hotel's breakfast was the best we had in Italy.   The grounds are spacious and well landscaped.  Service was very good, concierge recommendations for mainland restaurants were spot on.   Dont forget to take a swim in the rooftop pool which as a panoramic view of Venice.   Wifi was very good in public space and there are two options for in room, with a higher speed option at additional cost (25 euro).  Would return in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 1, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for your feedback on your recent stay!
