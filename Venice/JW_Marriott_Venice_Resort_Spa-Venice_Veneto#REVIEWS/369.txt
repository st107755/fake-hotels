We spent five days in Marriott and was simply like a dream. The place is absolutely paceful, you can feel the nature over the whole hotel.  Rooms are very comfortable and they are equipped with everything needed for a perfect stay. The staff is super friendly and always available to provide whatever we needed (concierge, restaurants, etc). Thanks to all, we hope we can come back soon!
