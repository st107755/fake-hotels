We had a long weekend here with friends recently and it was superb. The quality of  the accommodation, the service, food and grounds could not be faulted.  We had a meal on the roof one evening which was wonderful and we also spent quite a bit of time at the family pool where we swam. ate and played on the sports field with our kids. I was not sure if I would like being on an island away from Venice but it was perfect and the boat to St Marks left every 30 mins and the trip was about 20 mins.
