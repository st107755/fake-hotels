As Elite member (platinum) It has been my worst experience in JW Marriott world wide. No upgrade, no breakfast (they don't have a lounge and they want you to pay 28 EUR even if you are an elite plus member), if you want to access to the hotel swimming pool you have to pay 25 EUR, etc etc. At the end of it all they even don't credit the points.....Ok they are new, but is seems they don't have a clue of what they are doing.....or yes, it's clear that they don't' care about you as a customer but they only want to take money from your pockets!Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 5, 2016Dear Larosanera, thank you so much for taking the time to write a review.
