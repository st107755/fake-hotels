Loved this property located on a secluded island away from the crowds in Venice. Take advantage of their beautiful, private speed boat between San Marco square or the train station, ride a bike around the entire island, visit the spa, wedding chapel, a separate pool for the kiddies, an adult pool on the rooftop, good food & drinks on the rooftop restaurant and lounge, or enjoy the separate restaurant on island that requires advance reservations.Read moreDate of stay: June 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
