First I will say this was our first family stay at a JW and wow, was I impressed. You are water taxiâ€™d out to a private island. The resort sits here and has a great fitness room and spa, as well as incredible views. We were upgraded to the maison which was a 2story room with a small personal pool. My daughter loved it! The staff were incredibly attentive and courteous. Beds were comfy, baths clean. Would definitely go back if in Venice. Read moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare
