We had an amazing time with Chef Samuel! Made a special trip into the island early just to make it to the cooking school and it was worth it! We had so much fun, the food was great and Chef Samuel really took his time to explain things and make it a fun evening. We did the Pasta, Pasta, Pasta class. Definitely recommend for couples or families to do if you have the chance. Great way to spend the evening and make your own dinner!
