This is truly an exceptional hotel out of the hustle and bustle of the city.  Located on its own island right across the bay from San Marco, the hotel provides its own water taxi service every half hour to the San Marco district.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The restaurant was quite a pleasant surprise for both quality and service.  Just don't choose the "Kuttlefish" unless you understand it is a squid like meal.  The fitness facility and the spa are both ample and add to the experience.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 18, 2016Dear Lpatch, thanks for sharing feedback on your recent stay at our resort.
