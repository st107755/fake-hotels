We recently stayed in the JW Marriott on their own Island looking at Venice. A spectacular hotel with views of Venice and a private boat shuttle to take you back and forth to the island. Only two restaurants at night on the hotel island which means you can take the shuttle again back to Venice to eat and return as late as 12.30 midnight!  For us with smaller children who were exhausted after sight seeing and dragging them away from the outdoor family pool (heated!) meant we really were not returning to Venice to sample the fabulous restaurants on offer. That been said the hotel did accommodate children and a kids menu was on offer in their Sagra restaurant which is on the roof. Also a 1star Michelin restaurant available but we felt we didn't want to take kids to that!!!!!  Roomsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
