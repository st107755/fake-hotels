Opened in 2015, this resort is a collection of buildings with different styles.  We upgraded to a Junior Suite which has separate bedroom, bathroom, sitting area and walk-in closet, plus a huge veranda.  The resort is located on Rose Island which is a fairly long - but free - shuttle ride from ST. Mark's square.  The large and comfortable boats run every 30 minutes and take almost 20 minutes to make the journey.  The resort is a collection of meeting facilities, many restaurants, a church, a Spa, and pleasant grounds.  Housekeeping and staff and first rate and friendly and very helpful.  You could easily spend a week getting pampered here and still enjoy Venice.

We appreciate your kind comments about our impressive facilities, pleasant grounds and first-rate staff.  Did you have the chance to explore our private island by bicycle? One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with friends, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
