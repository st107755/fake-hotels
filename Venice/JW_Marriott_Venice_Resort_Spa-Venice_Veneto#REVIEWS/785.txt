Amazing brand new hotel.  Visited with the family Summer 2015. Flew in from Paris and the hotel's concierge arranged for a private pick-up at the airport.  The ride in the private boat was so much fun, and the grand entrance at the Hotel was unforgettable. My daughters are teenagers and loved the daily free shuttle from the hotel to Venezia.  The hotel was brand new at that time and was suffering some air conditioning issues but the hotel staff did everything they could to help us. The rooms are large with very comfortable beds.The free breakfast was very good.  Unfortunately due to AC issues we weren't able to experience the other restaurants comfortably.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Dec 22, 2016Dear Yvette G, thanks for your wonderful feedback.
