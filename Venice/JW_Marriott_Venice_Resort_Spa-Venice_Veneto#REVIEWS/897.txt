We are delighted to hear that you had an excellent stay at our magical Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful resort, lovely and helpful staff, excellent shuttle service, stunning spa and delicious food and cocktails.

All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager  Read more
