My daughter brought me here for my 70th birthday treat (and what a treat)!! The hotel, the rooms and food are fantastic. The housekeeping couldn't be faulted, the grounds and rooftop views are amazing. The staff are all so attentive and we would like to give a special thanks to Verena and Francesca who went above and beyond their call of duty, they certainly helped make this a trip of a lifetime!!!
