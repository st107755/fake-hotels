We have stayed in Marriotts in several countries, but this is by far the most luxurious. We were here for five nights on our recent Italian trip. The sunsets and views of the Venice skyline were lovely at dusk on the rooftop pool area. Our room was gorgeous and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet is lavish and delicious . Nearly everything in the way of breakfast food was available--- eggs, sausages, smoked salmon, fruit, breads, etc. Service was cheerful and efficient. The shuttle between the hotel and the San Marco dock ran about every 30 minutes and was very convenient. Enjoyed our stay at the JW!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
