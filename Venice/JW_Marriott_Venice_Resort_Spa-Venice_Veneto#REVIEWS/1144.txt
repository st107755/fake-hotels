Ok, this place is remarkable. I wasn't certain whether I wanted to stay off the mainland, but wow was this an incredible decision. Honestly, we couldn't wait to leave San Marco to return to the hotel! It's the ultimate in luxury an perfection. The service is impeccable and it's the better than I could have imagined. For those hesitating....don't!!!! The shuttle to town is quick and convenient. Overall, staying here was the best decision I made on my trip through Italy.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 5, 2016Dear ltk1973, thanks so much for your positive feedback. We appreciate your kind comments about our remarkable resort, impeccable service and quick and convenient shuttle to and from the hotel to San Marco Square.  I agree with your sentiment about our private island being an oasis right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort. Some guests even tell us that on some days they don’t leave our island! We are delighted to hear that you couldn’t wait to leave San Marco to return to our hotel.  Thank you for choosing JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
