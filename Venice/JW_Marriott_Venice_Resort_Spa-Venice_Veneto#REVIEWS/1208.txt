Newly opened, just about a year old, this is one of the best properties of Marriott that we have stayed in. Built on a separate island, the 20 minute boat ferry connects you to the mainland and is available till 1 am. Very convenient, makes site seeing easy. You can also get a direct connection to the Marco polo Airport via a water taxi. Well kept gardens, excellent swimming pools, grand lobby and spacious rooms make this a fantastic hotel. Not too many hotels in Venice are this spacious.
