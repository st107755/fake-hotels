Wonderful surprise oasis on private lagoon island.  Former expansive hospital with grand park, fields, its own church renovated with understated elegance.  Spacious rooms with upgrade potential to villas with duplex and plunge pools/Jacuzzi.  Service and front desk were very accommodating.  It even has its own Michelin starred restaurant, A short boat trip to and from Venice every half hour makes all the difference.  There is a contrast of worlds between crowded Venice and the tranquility and this place makes it all worth it.  If you have been to Venice and stayed in town, consider this as an alternative with its spacious rooms, modern baths, great food and service.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 30, 2016Dear pa2, thanks so much for your review.
