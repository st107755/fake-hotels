My wife and I recently spent 4 nights here.  It is a beautiful facility, and the staff is great!  We spent one day by their rooftop pool and on another day we reserved the spa suite and each had two treatments, which were excellent.  We highly recommend this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 31, 2016Dear Michael Y, thanks for your review.
