The property is located on an island around 25 mins boat ride away from St Marco square.  It is a beautiful majestic building. The rooms are very big and spacious. The service staff are very friendly. The facilities in the hotel are top class.   A good place to relax after a busy day of  shopping and sightseeing on the main island of Venice.  Recommended if you are looking for serenity and a place to relax.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
