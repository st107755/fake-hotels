The staff are so polite and helpful, the hotel is lovely, the facilities are great, the huge grounds are pristine and the whole place has a relaxed / quiet feel about it. The Doplovoro restaurant is the best we have ever been to and so worth a visit, the level of detail they put into their food and wine is a sight to behold. Yes the private island is 15 minutes by free shuttle from St Marks Square but the hotel cannot do anything about that can they. The shuttles run to time, we never once had to wait for the next one and the journey past other islands is really quite interesting, trust me it is so worth the trip we will certainly be back.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 5, 2017Dear Simon F, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We appreciate your kind comments about our polite and helpful staff, great facilities, pristine grounds and reliable shuttle service.  I am also glad to hear that you were impressed by your experience at Dopolovoro. Our resort is a culinary destination in Venice – only six months after its opening Dopolavoro obtained its first Michelin star under the leadership of one of Italy’s most celebrated chefs, Giancarlo Perbellini and his team. What is offered is a traditional but unique gastronomic dining experience. The restaurant is surrounded by our organic botanical gardens, which not only provide guests with a beautiful setting, but also a wide variety of produce that we use in our dishes. It is a luxury dining experience that is not to be missed.   Thank you for choosing to stay with us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
