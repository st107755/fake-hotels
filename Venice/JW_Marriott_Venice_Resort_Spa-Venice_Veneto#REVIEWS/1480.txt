Gorgeous. Arriving by private water taxi to JW Marriott Venice's private island retreat you know you are in for something special by first views on approach & arrival at the dock.   The hotel is effortlessly chic, modern, luxurious & beautifully designed.  Reception is light, bright & airy. Everything is new due recent grand opening with quality contemporay soft furnishings. Check in was smooth by delightful front office team. Had to wait for room due early arrival but boy was that wait worth it. Upgraded due Platinum Elite status to La Maisonette Duplex suite with pool - oh so fabulous. On two levels obviously with lounge and toilet/vanity downstairs. Manhattan loft style bedroom with luxuriously apopointed bathroom. Private garden with plunge pool, tables/chairs and loungers.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 29, 2015Dear Steve,  Your feedback left us so proud and happy, that we would like to deeply thank you.
