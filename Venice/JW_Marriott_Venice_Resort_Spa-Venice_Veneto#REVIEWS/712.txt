This is a difficult review to write.  The hotel is lovely, the staff very attentive, the grounds are wonderful.  But that's the problem.

You might as well be on a beach in Florida.  On the other hand, if you want to get away from Venice, especially in the heat of the summer, thus is the place for you.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
