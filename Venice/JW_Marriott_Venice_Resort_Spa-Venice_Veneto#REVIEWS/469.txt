What a place to go. The staff were great and the setting is unreal. Secluded from the bustle of Venice, but just a 20 minute shuttle to it if you want. The staff were behind the scenes but fast and they love children. I had reservations about staying off the main island but this place really was superb. We stayed in one of the Villas and the additional cost was well worth the extra room and tranquility, you have your own outdoor area too.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 11, 2017Dear joebutl, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We are grateful for your kind comments about our great staff, unreal setting and superb property.  Did you have the chance to explore our private island by bicycle? One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with friends, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
