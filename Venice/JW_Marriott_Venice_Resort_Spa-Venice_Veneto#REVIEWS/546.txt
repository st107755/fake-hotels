What an amazing trip we have had, booked by my fabulous husband of 25 years -JW Marriott resort Venice is breathtaking. All staff are attentive and friendly, you have to have a favourite though and ours was Turgut who works on the 4th floor in the Sagra bar. Fabulous,funny and handsome!!! He is well worth a visit, and so is the bar as well of course!!! The rooftop pool is fantastic with stunning views of Venice. I cannot rate this hotel highly enough, I don't want to go home!!!!
