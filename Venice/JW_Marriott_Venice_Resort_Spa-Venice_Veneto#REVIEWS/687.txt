We had an amazing stay at the JW Venice. From the room location by Carlos and the Front desk girls,  to the warmest welcome for dinner by the Dopolavoro team with Alice & the young sommelier together with Simone. Breakfast in Cucina was awesome with Andrea making it extra special with a Bellini and all the Cucina team ensuring We had a fabulous birthday celebration. We had lunch at Sagra and the experience was fantastic with Nicola's special coffee & Riccardo taking amazing care of us. We will definitely be back this is by far the place to stay in Venice, away from the crowds on your private island. Thanks a lot JW team!Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 2, 2017Dear MarifeMG, thank you for taking the time to write a review.
