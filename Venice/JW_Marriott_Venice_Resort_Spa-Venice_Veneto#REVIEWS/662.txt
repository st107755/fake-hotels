Hi,  We really enjoy the hotel. Everything is incredible there. People is so kind and always willing to make you feel like at home. The place is just amazing... No words to describe how peaceful and relaxing is. This was our second time and for sure not the last! Everything you need you will find there. And this is also a fantastic place either for families or just couples. If you visit Venice you cannot miss this hotel!!
