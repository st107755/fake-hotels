I had a most agreable stay at the J.W.Marriot Venice. Stunning views, splendid practical rooms that all have views over the sea or Venice, quiet.  I would give food however a 3,5 / 5, little bit disappointing but correct. Rooftop pool is just heaven. There is a shuttle boat of the hotel to Piazza San Marco every 30 min. Ideal for combination rest and visit of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 10, 2017Dear Alex D, thanks for writing a review.
