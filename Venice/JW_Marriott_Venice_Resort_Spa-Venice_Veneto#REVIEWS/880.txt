Excellent accommodation, friendly & helpful staff, delicious food & drink - and stunning views. Venice iis a fascinating and unique city but it's very busy. After a day of sightseeing, a short journey back on the hotel's shuttle boat to a relaxing environment was, for us, the best of both worlds. The staff at the hotel were exceptional, nothing was too much trouble. Special thanks to Laura in the Cucina who looked after us at breakfast every day with a friendly smile. One small down side was the number of wasps - it's probably just the time of year (September) but it was irritating when eating outside or laying by the pool.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 23, 2016Dear Alice462, thanks so much for your review. We are really grateful for your kind comments about our excellent accommodation, friendly and helpful staff, delicious food and drinks and stunning views.  I hope you had the chance to take part in on our Olive Oil Tasting tour during your stay with us. We love explaining to our guests the history of our 100 olive trees and how they grow. We also showcase different olive oils, including our own which is the only one produced in Venice and exclusively served at our Dopolavoro Dining Room.   With regards to your comments about the wasps, unfortunately this is an issue that all hotels located around the Lagoon experience during this time of the year. With the season coming to an end soon, we expect to see a significant reduction of this problem. Furthermore, we are also formulating a solid plan with our pest control company to ensure that this issue is minimised in the future.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
