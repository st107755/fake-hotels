Just back from a 3 night trip. I have to say this is probably the best 5 star hotel I have ever stayed in. Each and every one of the staff go out of their way for you and the hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous. Venice is so so busy and it was so nice to come back at the end of a hard day sightseeing to the pools and calmness. Food and drinks are expensive as you would expect in a property of this calibre, but the half hourly boat service gets you quickly into the centre and you can eat out in the various restaurants there if you donâ€™t want to pay hotel prices. We had lunch at the rooftop pool restaurant one day and it was lovely.  If I ever return to Venice, this is definitely where I will stay!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
