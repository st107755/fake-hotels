The JW Marriott Venice is a fabulous property on its own quiet island just 15 minutes away from the hustle and bustle of San Marco.  The amenities are bountiful on the sprawling property catering to everyone's tastes and delights including families, couples and business conference travelers.

We are grateful for your generous comments about our fabulous property, peaceful island, bountiful amenities and fantastic Kids Club. I will make sure to pass on your compliments to the Kids Club team – they will be happy to hear that your children enjoyed their time with us.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as an amazing Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you and your family back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
