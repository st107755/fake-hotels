What a delightful place for relaxing and being totally spoilt....  From the first moment we arrived at this quiet, tranquil resort we were treated as family. The staff are amazing - their warm welcome and genuine approach is wonderful - everyone was happy to chat and make us feel special. Rooms are very comfortable and spacious and wherever we were, staff couldn't do enough for us. Grounds are well maintained and there are bikes if you don't feel like walking. Don't miss the chance to stay here on this beautiful island if the opportunity arises.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 25, 2017Dear Jenny P, thanks so much for taking the time to write a review. We are grateful for your generous comments about our quiet and tranquil resort, amazing staff, spacious rooms and beautiful island.  It sounds like you were able to enjoy our lush grounds. Our century-old park is a 16-hectre expanse of greenery â€“ a mixture of old trees and soft lawns, which is impossible to find elsewhere in Venice. I think our historic gardens are one of the most picturesque locations with its scenic 360-degree views of Venice.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
