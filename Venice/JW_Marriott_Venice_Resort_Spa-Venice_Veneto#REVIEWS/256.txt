My partner and I stayed here for 4 days in July, the hotel and grounds are set on a private island and are beautiful, defining luxury. It was such a pleasure to come back and relax after a busy day sight seeing in a crowded Venice.  A complimentary shuttle boat runs to and from the island every 30mins, they are prompt and the crew are helpful, the short trips (approx 20mins) were a perfect opportunity to enjoy the sights along the way and relax on the water.   The rooftop area was extremely nice and relaxing, with beautiful views of Venice. It is a small area with an adult pool. Drinks are much pricier than anywhere else we went in Venice so be prepared to have deep pockets if you enjoy a few.   The breakfast was served in the Cucina restaurant and we chose to be seated outside.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
