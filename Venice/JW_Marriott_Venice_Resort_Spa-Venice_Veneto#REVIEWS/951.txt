The JW in Venice is one of my favorite resorts. We stayed in one of the 2 floor villas in the olive orchard. Its nice to leave Venice for the relaxation of the resort. Spend a few days to really enjoy the place. Shuttle in to St Marco every 30 min so its real easy to get around. Try the cooking classes on site.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 24, 2016Dear C3737MPmark, thanks for your feedback. We are thrilled to hear that our magical Isola delle Rose is one of your favorite resorts. We appreciate your kind comments about our relaxing atmosphere, convenient shuttle service and fun cooking classes.  Did you have the chance to explore our private island by bicycle? One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with loved ones, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
