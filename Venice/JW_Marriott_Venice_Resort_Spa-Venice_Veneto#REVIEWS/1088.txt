My friend and I returned to this beautiful hotel again, having stayed for 3 nights last July. We found the experience even more magical this time - upon arrival we were upgraded to one of the 11 rooms of La Residenza, set slightly apart from the hotel with its own beautiful garden overlooking the lagoon and a private plunge pool. Complimentary Prosecco, fruit and chocs awaited us and the room was tastefully decorated to the highest standard with a huge bathroom complete with walk in shower and enormous bath tub. It truly was like something out of The Night Manager! The breakfasts in La Cucina were amazing, have never experienced such a wonderful selection and all the staff there were so attentive, particularly Kiki who went out of her way to look after us.

We are grateful for your kind comments about our beautiful hotel, amazing food, wonderful staff, breathtaking views and fantastic facilities.  We are also glad that you had the chance to spend time in our beautiful botanic gardens and century-old park. Our Isola delle Rose – Island of Roses – has a rich history. Its position, halfway between the lagoon and sea, has given the island a special microclimate, which has encouraged the growth of plants and trees rare in Venice such as our 100 olive trees and inspired the establishment of a clinic of respiratory ailments at the beginning of the 20th century. We are proud of the historical roots of our private island and love to share the beauty of our grounds with our guests.  Thanks for returning to our resort and we hope to welcome you back for your third visit to our magical island again very soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
