The JW Marriott Venice is located on its own private island about 20 minutes away from San Marc Square. The hotel provides guests with a free boat shuttle to and from Venice to the hotel (which you will quickly realize, is a great accommodation!!).  Staying at the JW Marriott in Venice was such a luxurious experience. Everything you need for a relaxing stay you can find on the grounds with the option of Venice every 30 minutes. The grounds and rooms are clean with gorgeous landscaping and breathtaking views overlooking the water.  The staff were the best part and you can tell that they are passionate about making your stay at the JW Marriott all about you! You will always be greeted with a smile and a hello walking through the hotel as well as having a good chat with the staff…Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 28, 2017Dear Elizabeth S, thanks for your review.
