Our property is part of the Family by JW program which offers creative and enriching experiences designed for kids. Authentic to each hotel are fun-filled adventures curated to connect and inspire the whole family throughout your stay. This program also designs some special menus and amenities for our younger guests, including, for instance, balloons, teddy bears and a set of crayons with a related booklet to color. However, most of these activities are indeed designed for young children more than toddlers.
