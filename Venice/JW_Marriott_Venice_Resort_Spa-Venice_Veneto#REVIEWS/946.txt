Just returned from several days at this resort.  It was a perfect place to stay.  The resort is on its own island with a shuttle every 1/2 hour to St. Marks plaza.  The island and grounds are beautiful.  Families with young children love the special pool, playground, restaurant, etc.  We are an older couple (late 60s), been there, done that, and do not want to listen to screaming babies no matter how cute and we did not need to!  We loved it.  While the facilities are terrific, the staff is what makes it really special.  People bend over backwards to make sure you have an enjoyable visit.  The chef sent my wife his carbonnara recipe after we returned.  We will look forward to a return visit.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 26, 2016Dear ldouglee, thank you for taking the time to write a review.
