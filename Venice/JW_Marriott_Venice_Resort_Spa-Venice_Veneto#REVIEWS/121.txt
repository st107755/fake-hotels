Tiny and sparsely furnished room, no place to sit only on your bed. Extremely disappointed and definitely not return. Too far away from Venice-30mins trip by boat. The bathroom is in the room and there is no privacy.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Front Office Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 10, 2019Dear 1030507090,  thank you for your valued feedback about your recent experience at our JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa.  We truly regret to read about your overall disappointment with your stay, especially in regards of the room features and decor, as well as the location of the property.   Our hotel is located on a private island in the Venetian lagoon, and our complimentary shuttle service allows our guests to reach Venice within twenty minutes journey, which is scheduled every half an hour.  Being located on a secluded island, the JW Marriott offers unique services and facilities, such as the biggest Spa in Venice, a fitness center, outdoor bars and restaurants as well as a breathtaking rooftop pool overlooking the Venetian skyline. For all these aspects, the property can be considered a unique Resort nested in the Venetian lagoon.  However, we apologized for being unable to deliver the memorable experience we aim to convey to every guest.  Once again, thank you for your valued feedback.  Kindest regards,  Erica Travan Front Office ManagerRead more
