Booked a bi level pool suite at over $800/night.  Check in didn't happen until well after the 3 pm guarantee time.  Turndown didn't come until 10 pm on 2 of the nights.  And the room wasn't cleaned until we called at 5 pm both days.  The excuse was they were short staffed?   They offered me $100 credit for my troubles on a $3k bill which was a joke.  The family pool is packed to capacity and is WAY too small for the size of the hotel.  If that wasn't bad enough, the food is horrible.   My kids couldn't even eat the pizza?  How do you screw that up in Italy.
