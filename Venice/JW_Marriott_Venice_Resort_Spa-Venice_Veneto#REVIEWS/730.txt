Full marks to the architect for a brilliant design.  Spacious, gracious, elegant.  Probably the best hotel we have ever stayed at -- and we have been lucky to have travelled widely. Magic to ride across the laguna an into the covered hotel atrium in a water taxi, direct from the airport! And the staff -- literally cannot do enough for you.  Beautifully turned out, too.  Expensive for sure but you get what you pay for.   Forty acres of beautiful grounds with a Michelin starred restaurant on site, too.  The free shuttle to St. Mark's square criss crosses every 30 minutes.  Two different worlds, just 30 minutes apart.  Both fantastic.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 18, 2017Dear Patrick O, thank you so much for your glowing review. We appreciate your generous feedback about our brilliant design, spacious, gracious and elegant resort, beautiful grounds and attentive staff.  We are so proud of the beautiful design of our 19 buildings on our private island, which are the work of the renowned Italian architect Matteo Thun. His main focus was to integrate the contemporary elements of the existing buildings to showcase their unique history and personality, while at the same time enhancing the architectural heritage of our location.  Thank you for choosing to stay at the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
