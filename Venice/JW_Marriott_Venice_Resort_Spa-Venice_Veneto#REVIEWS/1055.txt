I had an absolutely fantastic time at the JW Marriott! I had never been to venice before and i fell in love from the start, as we came in on our water taxi to the hotel (which has its own island on the Venice lagoon) we checked in and went straight to the top terrace to see the view from the pool and it was incredible. A complete 360 degree view from the whole of the top terrace pool and bar.   Our room was stunning and we had a massive outdoor terrace with seating and sunbathing area which i would recommend especially for hot days.  The breakfast was stunning and the staff were all amazing, there is also a free shuttle boat to venice every half an hour which is lovely and easy to do.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough and i am already planning my next trip!Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 13, 2016Dear sophien333, thanks for your positive feedback. We are delighted to hear that you had an absolutely fantastic time at our resort. We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful hotel, incredible views, stunning rooms, delicious breakfast and amazing staff.  I agree, I think our rooftop pool is one of the best vantage points to admire breathtaking 360-degree views of Venice and the Lagoon. It is also the ideal place to watch the beautiful Venetian sunset. Many guests tell us how much they enjoy spending Happy Hour there while indulging in a glass of prosecco and some tapas from our Cicchetti Menu. It is an experience not to be missed.  Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
