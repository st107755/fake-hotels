Firstly, I stayed here on points so I can say it's a really good use of 169,000 points for five nights.  The resort is really well designed, highest quality finishes throughout and a lot of thought has gone into it.  The 20 minute boat ride to St Mark's square is a welcome diversion from the hustle in main Venice.   Air con worked well and food quality was top notch. Service was more or less indifferent and the prices just a little on the high side.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 4, 2015Dear Michael,  Thank you for your nice review; for us, it has been a real pleasure to have welcomed you to our magical town and simply have been a part of your travel experience in Venice.
