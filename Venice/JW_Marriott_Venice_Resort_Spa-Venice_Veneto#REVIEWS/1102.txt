We were supposed to stay in JW Marriott for 2 Nights next week. It took me days to organize this trip. The hotel decided to renovate the rooms in the middle of summer. So they cancelled our reservation.  And they did it in a very dubious way.  Since we were going with another family, they were informed about this renovation two days ago. So I called the hotel they said that our rooms will still be available because only the main building was getting fixed. We were supposed to stay in a studio room, that's located separately. But today Expedia called and said the hotel cancelled our reservation. And when I called JW they lied and said Expedia cancelled. They are not trustworthy and I'm very disappointed. At least they could be honest and admit that they decided to give our roomsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 17, 2016Dear Arshaluys H, we are very sorry to hear about the miscommunication regarding your reservation at our resort.
