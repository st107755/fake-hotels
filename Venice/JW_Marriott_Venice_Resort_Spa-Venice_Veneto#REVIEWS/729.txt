Great hotel would thoroughly recommend this! We came for a babymoon and everything has been perfect from the suite to the service. The Goco spa is a must and the sauna/ steamroom in the gym and rooftop pool are all a perfect way to chill after a day in Venice!

We are delighted that you enjoyed spending your babymoon at our magical Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your kind comments about our perfect customer service, nice suites and relaxing GOCO Spa.  I agree, I think our spa is such a wonderful experience and you can spend a whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. The largest in Venice, it also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
