We appreciate your generous comments about our friendly and efficient staff, beautiful and luxurious guest rooms, amazing views, stunning grounds and superb food.  We hope your next visit with us will be a longer one – there is so much to do at our magical Isola delle Rose. When the team and I were organising the excursions that we wanted to provide our guests, we thought of all the things that would be part of the ultimate travel experience of Italy.

All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
