Beautiful modern complex with great rooms and facilities. A little more of a boat ride away from the main attractions. Arriving my speed boat is pretty impressive though. Has a great spa and meeting rooms for your business event but would also be nice for a personal visit.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 20, 2016Dear Mark G, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful and modern property and great facilities.  I am delighted that you were impressed with our arrival experience. Many of our guests compare their VIP arrival to something out of a James Bond movie! I hope that you had the chance to enjoy our gorgeous grounds. I think our historic gardens are one of the most picturesque locations with its scenic 360-degree views of Venice â€“ it is the ideal place to watch the beautiful Venetian sunset.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
