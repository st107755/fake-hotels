We appreciate your generous comments about our impressive and modern hotel, luxurious rooms, excellent staff, beautiful views and delicious restaurants.  I am also glad to hear that you were able to take part in the complimentary pasta making class at Dopolavoro. Next time you visit us, I would recommend the Authentic Venice class at our Sapori Cooking Academy – it is such an unforgettable experience! The morning starts off with meeting Chef Micki and travelling together via private water taxi to the colorful Rialto Market. He helps you choose the freshest ingredients to take back to the resort where he teaches how to prepare delicious dishes following the Venetian culinary tradition. Plus you get to enjoy the lunch that you helped prepare. It is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the local culture.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
