The first time we stayed at a JW Marriott Hotel, from the time we arrived by private water taxi into the hotel we experienced first class service. We stayed in a Garden Room and the room was very luxurious and comfortable.  The staff were so tentative and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was very varied and the restaurants food was delicious. Cannot find fault with this hotel it is a relaxing sanctuary after a busy day in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 19, 2016Dear RebeccaBlueSky, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our first-class customer service, luxurious and comfortable rooms, friendly staff and delicious food.  I agree, what we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to Venice proper means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and feel pampered at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope you visit us again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
