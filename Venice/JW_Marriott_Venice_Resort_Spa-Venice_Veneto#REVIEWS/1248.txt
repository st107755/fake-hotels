A stunning resort island covered in trees and surrounded with views. An overwhelmingly kind and helpful staff. Convenient and dependable transportation to the Venice island. Beautifully appointed rooms and decor with touches like heated towel racks (and floors?) and pillow chocolates. It is a dream. I highly recommend the Junior Suite which offers a large balcony with cozy chairs -- ours had a beautiful view of the grounds and the ocean beyond. The only complaint I have is that mowing or weed-eating noise interrupted much of our time on the terrace, to some extent a necessary evil to maintain such beautiful grounds.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 22, 2016Dear kmcwelch, thanks so much for your wonderful feedback.
