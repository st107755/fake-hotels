The resort is on an island 10 minutes on a boat from St. Marco square which makes it perfect for escaping the beehive of central Venice. The hotel is wonderfully run and all details were taken care of. The island is very quiet and the hotel staff does everything to maintain it that way. Rooms are big and they have big terraces. Very clean and user friendly. Staff was polite and discrete and our kids had fun despite this being a luxury hotel. Would always recommend it as a good break from the busy Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
