Arrived James Bond style on a private water taxi to the entrance of the JW Marriott resort dock which pulls up into the hotel . We were welcomed onto the isola de Rosa where the hotel is on its own private island across from the mainland . The  service including private check in by GIANMARCO who was particularly helpful was excellent and we were promptly offered an upgrade to a suite as Marriott silver elite member .   Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that would like a first class service in beautiful surroundings . The private Shuttle onto the island runs every half an hour and you get a fabulous view of Venice as you come into St Marks square. Nice to have the tranquility of the island after the bustle of Venice Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 27, 2016Dear karenobriensmith, thanks so much for writing a review.
