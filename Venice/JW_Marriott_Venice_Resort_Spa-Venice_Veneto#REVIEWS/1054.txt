A very good hotel with some very helpful staff, perfect for a couples break or equally for a family as the hotel has separate swimming pools! The rooftop pool is adults only although the odd youth had been sneaked in but no kids ! Next to the pool is the rooftop bar / restaurant which is a very popular area so booking to avoid disappointment is essential! it is not cheap but good food and drinksRead moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 13, 2016Dear Neill M, thanks for your review.
