The hotel is Perfectly located on small island. It is good spot to visit Venice. The shutlle is every 30 min between Marriott and San Marco. Also after a long day You can rest in silence of the hotel and island. The rooms are very nice - i was upgreaded to 6xx rooms which are in separate building with private consierge. The staff and service very good, they try to help You. The pool bar on the roof with beautifull view on Venice - amazing in evening. I Will come back!Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
