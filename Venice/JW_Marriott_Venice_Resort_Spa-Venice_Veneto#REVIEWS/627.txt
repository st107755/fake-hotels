If you are staying overnight in Venice, do yourself a favor and stay here!  This Marriott is on its own private island with a boat shuttle that makes frequent trips from early morning until late night.  Each building has a slightly different theme.  Every room is immaculate, updated and the staff here is so very friendly.  There is a pool spa and more.  The building with suites overlooks the olive orchard.  You could spend a week just relaxing in this resort.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 1, 2017Dear bb9000cde, thank you for your positive feedback. We appreciate your kind words about our private oasis, immaculate rooms and friendly staff.  I have noticed that some of our guests plan a trip to Venice for only a few nights but the feedback I have received from all of them afterwards is that they wished they stayed longer. Our guests are pleasantly surprised by the many activities that we offer as well as our amazing facilities, such as the GOCO Spa. We always encourage our guests to book a longer stay â€“ at least four or five nights so that they can experience all the wonderful things that we have.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
