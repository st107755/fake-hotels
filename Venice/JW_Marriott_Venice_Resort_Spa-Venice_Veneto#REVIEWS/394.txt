We stayed here on 4 day trip thru Italy.  Its a beautiful resort providing a quiet secluded location.   If you're looking for a quiet luxurious getaway thats close to Venice but not in the middle of everything, then this is it.

We appreciate your generous comments about our beautiful resort, secluded location, friendly and helpful staff and comfortable rooms.  We believe having the ability to escape Venice’s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit, our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
