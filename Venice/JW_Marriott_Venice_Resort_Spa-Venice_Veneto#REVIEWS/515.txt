Wonderful stay and beautiful property. Staff was extremely helpful, room was good. The breakfast spread was satisfying. The island is stunning and has a regular service to San Marco station by boat, so accessibility is good.

We are delighted that you had a wonderful stay at our beautiful Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your kind comments about our helpful staff, good rooms, stunning island and convenient shuttle service.  It sounds like you were able to enjoy our lush grounds. Our century-old park is a 16-hectre expanse of greenery â€“ a mixture of old trees and soft lawns, which is impossible to find elsewhere in Venice.

Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
