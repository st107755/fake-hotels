This hotel is the first JW Marriott in Italy.  It is located on an island and is reached by a motor launch which pulls right up to the lobby.  The decor of the hotel is simple, yet elegant.  The view from our bedroom was magnificent!  Bedding, amenities (dental and shaving kit were also included), robes, slippers , live plants, and special reading lights were all special touches.  The breakfast was fabulous and our server kept filling our large coffee cups with strong Cafe Americano.    There were many fake switch plates and switches in our room.  A night light would have been helpful to see in the dark.  The large room only had one chair and it was difficult to regulate the room temperature.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 27, 2016Dear waters35, thank you so much for your review.
