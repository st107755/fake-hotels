Wow..what a gourgeous hotel, everywhere is fresh and modern and incredibly clean. The rooms are spacious and beds so comfortable with feather pillows. Spacious bathroom and beautiful views of the grounds from our room. There's tea/coffee making facilities in the room, a mini fridge and free safe.  The outside pool offers complementary bottled water and towels for the sunbeds. The outside pool is cooler than the roof top pool so if you need to cool off that's a good choice. The rooftop pool has beautiful views of Venice, a lovely pool, which is not deep so the water is warm,half the pool has raised seats and buttons along the side so you can turn on the jacuzzis. The staff regularly walk around to see if you need anything, even bring you cold flannels on hot days, Food and drinkâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
