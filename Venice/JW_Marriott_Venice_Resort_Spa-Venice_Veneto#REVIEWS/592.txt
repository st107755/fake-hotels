We had a wonderful visit to the JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa.  The property was beautiful and the rooms were clean, large and elegant.  We loved the rooftop restaurant and bar as well as the bar in the main lobby. The only suggestion/complaint that we had was that the food was really really expensive on property. Lunch for three of us (two glasses of wine, water, a kids meal, a sandwich and a cheese and meat platter) was 150 Euros.  A nice meal, but again, too pricey for what it was.  I would strongly recommend that the hotel offer some lower cost on property options. Despite above, we will definitely return- the service and property are well worth the price of the hotel itself.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 17, 2017Dear Laurie B, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful property, large and elegant rooms and good customer service.  We are so proud of the beautiful design of our 19 buildings on our private island, which are the work of the renowned Italian architect Matteo Thun. His main focus was to integrate the contemporary elements of the existing buildings to showcase their unique history and personality, while at the same time enhancing the architectural heritage of our location.  Thank you for choosing to stay at the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
