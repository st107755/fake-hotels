We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of May / beginning or June.  We took the hotel shuttle from St Marks square (clearly marked 50 meters from where the water bus moors - just opposite the royal gardens). The hotel shuttle takes about 20 min to the hotel and there is cold still/ sparkling water available - you are not told about it but there is a fridge when you get on the boat on your left when you come down the stairs to the main cabin under the seat. We only found out from other passengers when we went on board.  First impressions are great - the hotel is on it's own island and it looks fantastic when you arrive.  We arrived at around 1pm (check in is at 3pm) and when we sat down were told that our room was available - great - but that it was a twin room with separate bedsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
