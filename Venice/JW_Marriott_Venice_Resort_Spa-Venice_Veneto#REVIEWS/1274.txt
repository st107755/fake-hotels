We came as a family and it was great! Only 20 minutes by boat (which is always a relaxing way to start a day of full exposure of culture and art) from Venice.  The swimming pool on the rooftop was excellent and the staff were extremely helpful and smiley! Alessandra at reception was exceptional and was there for all our needs and questions.  I met Mr. Perotti assistant front of house manager whom was also lovely!  All in all I had a lovely experience and really enjoyed our stay. Would definitely come back!Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 2, 2016Dear Alexia v, thank you so much for providing a review. We are delighted that you and your family had a great time at our Isola delle Rose. We are grateful for your kind feedback about our amazing rooftop swimming pool and lovely staff.  Our resort offers a number of fun amenities tailored for families. Did you get the chance to make use of our JW bicycles, included in the Resort Package? It is such a fun and relaxing way to explore our private island and discover our century-old park and gardens, which is the home to a variety of vegetables, orchards and even an olive grove with a hundred trees â€“ from which we make our own olive oil for our restaurants.  Thank you for choosing the JW Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
