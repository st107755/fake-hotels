The JW Marriott Venice is a resort on a private island around a 20 minute boat ride from Piazza San Marco.  The hotel is modern and clean with multiple restaurants, bars and activities such as bike riding, soccer and swimming.  We originally planned to stay in Venice but with a 12 year old, we had a hard time finding anything that worked.  We weren't sure we should be staying outside of Venice but choosing this hotel was actually the best decision we made.  While our son enjoyed some aspects of the city, he had more fun at the hotel and I would suggest anyone travelling to Venice with a young family to strongly consider this property.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 26, 2016Dear Wig123, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate all your kind comments about our modern hotel, good selection of restaurants and wide range of activities.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as an amazing Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for staying at our Isola delle Rose and we hope to welcome you and your family back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
