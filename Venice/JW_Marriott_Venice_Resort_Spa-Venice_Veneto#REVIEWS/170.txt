We only spent one night at this Hotel and wished we had planned a couple more nights.  The rooms were large & the beds were so comfortable.  The only issue we had was that the shower flooded..  But not really a big issue with the huge extra towels that they leave.  The rooftop bar and pool are amazing and there is free shuttle to the island for traveling and pleasure.  We were so sad to leave this amazing hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
