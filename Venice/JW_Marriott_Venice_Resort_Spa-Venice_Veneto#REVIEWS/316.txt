We had a great  stay at the JW in Venice. Nice place to relax and for the kids to enjoy the pool after touring the city.  The amenities and grounds are amazing. And the staff across the board were super friendly and helpful, especially Gianmarco at the front desk and Turaut, Cosimo, Teona, and Leonardo in the lobby restaurant/bar. They made our meal on our last night very nice. We also would highly recommend the breakfast buffet in the morning.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
