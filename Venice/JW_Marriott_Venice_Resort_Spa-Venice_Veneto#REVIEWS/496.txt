Location is outstanding. Rooftoop pool with view on San Marco and overall Venice is incredible. Room is very wide. Breakfast is sumptuous. Nice to have a park where to walk while being 20' from Venice downtown. Price is of course adequate...Read moreDate of stay: August 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 31, 2017Dear guidolo, thanks for your wonderful feedback. We appreciate your kind words about our outstanding location, incredible views and sumptuous breakfast.  We hope you had the chance to check out some of the activities and excursions that we offer at our resort such as our Sapori Cooking Academy, which is a big hit with our guests. The morning program we offer is such an unforgettable experience. The day starts off with meeting our Chef and travelling together via private water taxi to the colourful Rialto Market. He helps you choose the freshest ingredients to take back to the resort where he teaches how to prepare delicious dishes following the Venetian culinary tradition. Plus, you get to enjoy the lunch that you helped prepare. It is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the local culture â€“ I highly recommend it.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
