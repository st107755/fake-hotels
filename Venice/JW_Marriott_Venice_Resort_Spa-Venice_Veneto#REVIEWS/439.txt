Loved our stay at this resort, from when we  got off of our private taxi boat to leaving we felt like movie stars. The staff are exceptional, your every need is catered for.  It was the most enjoyable time I have ever had.  Book the depolova restaurant on the resort, a must.

We are delighted that you loved your stay at our magical Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your kind comments about out exceptional staff.  I am also thrilled that you enjoyed your dining experience at Dopolavoro. Our Executive Chef, Federico Belluco is an impressive person. He is a perfectionist and works everyday for at least 14 hours. Even on his days off he loves to experience and develop our culinary offering. When the resort is closed for the winter, Federico travels the world to find inspiration. We are very proud of all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes.  Thanks for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
