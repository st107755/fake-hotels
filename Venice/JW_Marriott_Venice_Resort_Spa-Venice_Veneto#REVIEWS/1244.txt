Absolutely loved this resort and cannot wait to go back one day...we were upgraded to a suite as there was a large cruise ship in. Loved the help yourself sweet jars which changed each day in reception.  The staff were so well dressed and spoke excellent English. Enjoyed a yoga class on the lawn in early morning sunshine whilst lizards basked on the walls  I never usually  do classes but it looked so inviting. Arriving in reception on an wooden speed  boat made me feel like a film star. The rooms were tastefully decorated and comfy. The boats to St Marks square went often..and we were entertained by the American tourists on the way..altho bout twenty minutes each way. The gym was good not that I used it and the aluminium roof top infinity pool was divine..real luxury..shame it…Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 25, 2016Dear Miss_Adventure09, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We are grateful for your kind comments about our friendly staff, fun activities and beautiful grounds.  I am delighted that you were impressed with your arrival experience. Many of our guests compare their VIP arrival to something out of a James Bond movie! I am also glad that you had the chance to enjoy our gorgeous grounds. I think our historic gardens are one of the most picturesque locations with its scenic 360-degree views of Venice – it is the ideal place to watch the beautiful Italian sunset.  Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
