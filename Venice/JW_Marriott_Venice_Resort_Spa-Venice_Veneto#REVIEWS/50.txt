Thank you to everyone at JW Marriott Venice. This is amongst the best of Marriott I have stayed at. Service was fantastic and the hotel grounds and rooms were excellent. Special thanks to Gulia at check in reception, George with helping us with our luggage and everyone at breakfast in Dopolavoro. We felt so welcomed and special. Thank you.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare
