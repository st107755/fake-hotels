Want to enjoy all Venice has to offer and then retreat to a resort and spa on an island away from the tourists.  This is the place.  The service is five-star, the views at night of San Marcos and at dawn of a placid Bay are not to be equaled elsewhere.  Inexpensive - no, but worth every penny (or Euro) - absolutely.  Room was clean and well maintained, restaurants superb, cocktails to relax, spa to do the same, gardens to stroll and a concierge service that was excellent.  Only 20-minute hotel taxi to San Marcos ad they pick up every half-hour.  Read moreDate of stay: June 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
