Venice rounded out our 2 week trip in Italy, and the JW is a beautiful island hotel!  The service was great, the hotel brand new and ultra modern, and the grounds are worth the walk around.  With that said, my wife and I checked out after the first night and moved into the Boscolo Venezia for our remaining 3 nights.  Nothing was wrong with the JW, my wife and I just wanted a more authentic hotel rather than the ultra modern JW plus easier access to the city and Trattoria's for meals.  As a Platinum Marriott traveler the JW was great in allowing us to make the change the next morning with no penalties and helped with our transfer to the other Marriott property.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
