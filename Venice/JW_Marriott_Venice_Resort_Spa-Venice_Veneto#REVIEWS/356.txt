I am a platinum member of marriot rewards. I have stayed with Marriott for 390 nights over 4 years.   We stayed on this property in April 2018 - our money was robbed from our room by the room service. We reported this incident to the hotel staff but they merely said “from now on, you can deal with our insurance company”  As a platinum member with Marriott, I am NEVER staying at any Marriott presorty, SPG is the way to go   In addition, the shuttle is very inconvenient- you have to work your entire day around the shuttle. If you miss it, be ready to pay 90 euros for a 20 Min ride. Not worth the money. You are also likely to get robbedRead moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
