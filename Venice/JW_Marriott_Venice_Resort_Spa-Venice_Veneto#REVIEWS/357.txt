It was the most magical place, totally serene and peaceful. We had a better deal staying in the Uliveto which included breakfast, Wifi and a gorgeous little deck attached to our room. Location was perfect as it was away from the main hotel meaning it was quieter but still close enough for all amenities. We had the most incredibly helpful concierge in the Uliveto section called Gabrielle, he was wonderful. Gave us the best recommendations, always came with a smile and was just an all round pleasure, nothing was to much of a chore for him. And the lovely Massimo who was always a smiling, helpful face around the grounds. On more than one occasion he helped us out. The food from head chef Carlotta in the rooftop restaurant was amazing. Shuttle service to and from Venice was so easyâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
