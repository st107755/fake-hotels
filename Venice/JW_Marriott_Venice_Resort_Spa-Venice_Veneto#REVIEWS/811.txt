Just come back from a long weekend at this beautiful hotel on an island about a 15 minute boat ride from St Marks Square. Stayed in a great junior suite. The hotel is surrounded by extensive grounds and is a peaceful haven from the hustle and bustle of mainland Venice. The staff were friendly and gave first class service. Courtesy shuttle launch to and from the mainland every half hour and to Murino glass factory. A great base from which to explore the city.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 3, 2016Dear wisemanclive, thanks for your positive review. We appreciate your kind comments about our beautiful hotel, extensive grounds, friendly staff and first-class service.   I agree, I think one of the main benefits of staying on your own private island is the serene retreat our resort provides after a busy day in Venice. Venice is certainly an exciting and thrilling destination, with its vibrant culture and rich history as well as the hustle and bustle of its crowded streets but many of our guests tell us that they like being able to come back to our relaxing hotel after a full day on the main island.   Thank you for choosing to stay at our magical Isola delle Rose and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
