Excellent island hotel, we had an amazing view over the gardens from a junior suite on the 1st floor. I am going to submit photos to speak for themselves. We had a relatively small incident while there that we are waiting to hear back from the management about. Do be aware that the hotel as a whole is not yet finished, but out time there has made us want to go back when it is... there is nowhere like this hotel in Venice, tranquility away from the main city.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 29, 2015Dear Sebastian,  Thanks for your feedback!
