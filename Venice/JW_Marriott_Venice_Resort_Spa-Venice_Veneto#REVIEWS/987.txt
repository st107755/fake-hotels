We liked the quiet atmosphere on the Island.  Looks like they grow their own vegetables, as I saw a garden, by the family pool and chapel.  We played a little badminton, swam in the pool, ate and relaxed all over the island.  We took a boat during the day and back in evenings to Venice and enjoyed our time filling it with the activities we wanted to do/see. The people that work at JW Marriott were very kind and I enjoyed talking to all of them that I had a conversation with.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 10, 2016Dear volleyit, thanks for your review. We are grateful for your generous comments about our quiet atmosphere, fun activities and kind staff. We are also thrilled that you noticed our botanical garden. Our Isola delle Rose has a rich history. Its position, halfway between the lagoon and sea, has given the island a special microclimate, which has encouraged the growth of plants and trees rare in Venice such as our 100 olive trees and inspired the establishment of a clinic of respiratory ailments at the beginning of the 20th century. We are proud of the historical roots of our private island and love to share the beauty of our grounds with our guests.  Thanks for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
