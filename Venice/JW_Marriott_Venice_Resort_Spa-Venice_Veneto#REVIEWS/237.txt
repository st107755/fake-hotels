This was my second visit to JW Marriott in venice  Me and my family's room was nice and clean. We had a terrace with a good view of the island. Down at the kids pool there was also a waterpark and a playground. The food at the pool was good but the service was average. The problem was the bugs. When we had our food out many bees and other bugs annoyed us and wanted to eat our food. Down at the pool we asked for a candle to get rid of the bugs but they only had a spray.  At the rooftop hotel Sagra, the service was slow and the food was slightly below average. My mom said it was overpriced for what it is.  TIP: If you have to eat in Sagra eat inside, outside mosquitoes will eat you aliveRead moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
