This hotel worked great for me and my BF--he's been to Venice and was looking for a more laid back experience, and I wanted to see the city. There is a ferry by San Marco that will take you to Isla Rosa (about 25 minutes) and goes ever half hour until around midnight to and from the hotel. They also had a morning ferry to the train station, which was convenient. Our room was very clean and modern. We passed on the breakfast because it was crazy expensive but did order coffee from the little store/cafe, and it was great.  Pool and grounds were beautiful and staff was really accommodating.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
