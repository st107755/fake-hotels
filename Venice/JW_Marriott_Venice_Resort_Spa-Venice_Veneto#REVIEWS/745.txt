Though we only booked the standard room, it had fab views of the lagoon.  The staff cannot do enough for you and nothing is too much trouble.  The complementary shuttle to St Marks square was convenient and a frequent service. The whole island the hotel sits on was beautiful and big enough that you didn't run into lots of other guests.  A special mention to the team by the pool/pool bar - they were probably the most down to earth of all the staff that were there which suited the atmosphere up there whether having a drink or a meal by the pool or just lounging on a sunbedRead moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 12, 2017Dear Linda B, thank you so much for your review. We appreciate your generous comments about our fabulous views, convenient shuttle service and beautiful island.  I am also delighted to hear that you enjoyed spending time at our Rooftop Pool. You might be interested to hear that we recently changed the concept of our Rooftop Pool so that it is for adults only. We were inspired by the exclusive Members Only clubs with the likes of Soho House in Berlin and wanted to offer our adult guests a perfect lounge style pool with a sophisticated but relaxing atmosphere and amazing views of Venice.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
