We stayed here for 3 nights and truly enjoyed ourselves.  The boat shuttle is on time and very comfortable.  It runs every 30 minutes between S. Marco and the hotel.  As we spent most of our time in Venice, we only ate breakfast at the hotel.  Breakfast was very good and the staff are very attentive.  You have a choice of the buffet or ala carte.  On our last day, we took advantage of the GOCO Spa.  A wonderful experience. We did the 3 hour spa suite which includes a 120 minute treatment and an additional hour gor relaxation after. I highly recommend this.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 4, 2016Dear Bill F, thanks so much for your review.
