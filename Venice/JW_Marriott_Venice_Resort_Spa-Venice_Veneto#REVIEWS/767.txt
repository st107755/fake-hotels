Well for starters, just pulling into the dock at the hotel (it's on a private island) is impressive.  The front desk staff did upsell a better room but considering what we got for a modest charge, it was worth it.  The island is beautiful with lots of flowers and olive trees.  The hotel restaurant is on the top floor of the main building and has a commanding view of the city.  With a beautiful sunset to be had any clear night.  The restaurant is very nice but I would have to say pricey.  A more reasonable meal can be had at any number of establishments in the city which is only a ten to fifteen minute water taxi ride (free).  Breakfast was great and the room which we ended up with was awesome.  Very large and comfortable with its own private deck and lounge chairs.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 10, 2017Dear Christopher W, thank you so much for taking the time to write a review. We appreciate your kind comments about our lovely hotel, great location, impressive arrival experience, large rooms and commanding views from our rooftop restaurant Sagra.  You might be interested to hear that besides the regular menu at Sagra, we also offer a special menu from the Cicchetti Bar, which are Venetian-style tapas. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden. One of my favorite dining experiences is enjoying these Venetian-style tapas while overlooking the dramatic skyline of the Lagoon during sunset at our rooftop.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
