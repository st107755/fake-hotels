Had a wonderful time at this hotel that provides luxury and new facilities which is different than a lot of the other older luxury hotels in Venice. The hotel staff was quite friendly and offered an upgrade and a complementary bottle of wine and sweets for our honeymoon visit. Thumbs up for great quality and variety in breakfast including the Nutella and pistachio pizza. The shuttle service of every 30 min was fine and even offered free Wi-Fi. The airport vip shuttle is also very good. The hotel could, however, improve on offering free Wi-fi and free access to the spa given the room rates.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
