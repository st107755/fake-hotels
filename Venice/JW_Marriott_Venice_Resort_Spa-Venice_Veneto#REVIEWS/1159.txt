JW Marriott was our first stop on a two-week trip to Italy for our Silver Anniversary. The service at the hotel was excellent with an exceptional staff, especially Marco Pelloti at the check-in. All were very attentive and made it very special for us with celebratory Prosecco when we arrived in our room. A complimentary trip to Murano was included during our stay. The shuttle to San Marco was super convenient and the property itself is beautifully landscaped. Nice to get away from the bustle of Venice to this island.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 1, 2016Dear Jyoti G, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We are grateful for your kind comments about our excellent customer service, convenient shuttle service to and from Venice proper and beautifully-landscaped property.  I totally agree with you, Venice is an ideal location as a first stop for an Italian holiday. Our airport is the third biggest in the country with connections to almost every single cosmopolitan city in the world and direct flights to several cities in Europe. Furthermore, the train system can take you to Milan, Rome, Florence or even as south as Napoli. We always encourage our customers to spend four or five nights in our resort and have a vacation within a vacation.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
