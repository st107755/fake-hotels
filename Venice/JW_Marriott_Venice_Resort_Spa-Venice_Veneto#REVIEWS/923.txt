After a day of sight seeing and exploring, it was a pleasure to come back to this spacious property. We stayed in of the suites and amenities were great. It was probably too big for 2 of us but it was very nice. We did have a bit of an air conditioning problem but it was swiftly taken care of by a very concerned staff. The shuttle service was always on time and runs every 1/2 hour. The outdoor pool area was very nice and staff was excellent. a great place that i would come back to.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 4, 2016Dear Jonathan_Landsberg, thanks so much for your positive feedback.
