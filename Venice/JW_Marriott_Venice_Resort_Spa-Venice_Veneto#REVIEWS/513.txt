We took a private water taxi to the JW Marriott from the airport after a long flight from the states.  The arrival dock is impressive as pictures of the resort will illustrate and the bellmen were helpful.  When we arrived at the reception area to check in it was 9:30 a.m. and we did not expect our room to be ready but we did expect a warmer reception.  The person who checked us in told us they only had one room and it is on the 1st floor based on our rate.  Our rate was purchased through the Marriott website as Marriott rewards members and was not a low ball rate purchased through a 3rd party website.  It was somewhat insulting.  We were traveling with friends who were checking in simultaneously at the desk next to us where they were given one of the 4 rooms on the 4th floor. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 23, 2017Dear Bon1000, thank you for taking the time to write a review.
