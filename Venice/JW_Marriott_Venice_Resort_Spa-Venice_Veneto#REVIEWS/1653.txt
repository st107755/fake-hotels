We have just got back from Venice after 3 nights at The J W Marriott it was  all-out romance with an enchanting break at a brand-new luxury resort on a private island - including flights and a plush Junior Suite, it is a breath of fresh air to have a great new hotel so close to Venice, you get used the shuttle, the staff were very good and the food exceptional, plenty of dining options, Free Wi-Fi in the room.. i will be back that for sure. we booked via a company @SavviTravel who dealt with every detail of our stay from the Orient Express down to the hotel. will use both again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 6, 2015Dear Gerry,  We would like to thank you for your feedback.
