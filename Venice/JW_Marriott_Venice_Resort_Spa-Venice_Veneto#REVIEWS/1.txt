We booked a non-refundable rate (I know, never again) because our stay was planned just prior to embarking on a cruise in June.  COVID-19 changed all that, and more, but our initial request for a cancellation and refund was refused, citing the rate terms, and despite having been told by the Marriott agent who took the cancellation that we would be refunded.  It took a couple more email, but in the end Paola Toniolo, Reservations Manager Venice Area, agreed and saw to it that we would get a refund, which we have received.  Many thanks for the help, and we still look forward to visiting in the future.  May you and your family stay safe and healthy.Read moreDate of stay: April 2020ValueLocationServiceHelpfulShare
