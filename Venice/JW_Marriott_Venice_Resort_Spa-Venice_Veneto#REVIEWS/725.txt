Initially we were hesitant about being 20 minute water taxi ride from the main area BUT that was a bonus. To be on an island it was quiet, safe, great services and views every direction. The gardens are lovely to walk around in, the roof top restaurant was wonderful . Even though food was a little expensive it was certainly not much different to over on the main island. It was great fun using the water taxis as this is the only transport to move from one place to another in all of Venice.

We are grateful for your kind comments about our safe and quiet island, lovely gardens, beautiful views and wonderful food.  As you mentioned, we believe having the ability to escape Veniceâ€™s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit, our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
