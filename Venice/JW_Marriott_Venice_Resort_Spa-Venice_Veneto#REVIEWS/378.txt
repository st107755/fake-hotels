My wife and I stayed here for a night on our honeymoon. We particularly loved the location of the private island and the fact that it was removed from the craziness of mainland Venice. The property was well manicured and the rooms quite spacious and clean. The HIGHLIGHT of our stay was meeting a kind gentleman by the name of Massimo who helped us with our bags and made us feel right at home. Thank you Massimo!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
