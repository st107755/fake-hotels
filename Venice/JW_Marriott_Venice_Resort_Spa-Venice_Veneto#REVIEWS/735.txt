We appreciate your generous comments about our beautiful and ultra modern lobby, quiet and tranquil rooms, friendly and approachable staff and delicious food.  With regards to your comments about our rooftop pool, you might be interested to hear that as of May 18th, it is for adults only. We were inspired by the exclusive Members Only clubs with the likes of Soho House in Berlin and wanted to offer our adult guests a perfect lounge style pool with a sophisticated but relaxing atmosphere and amazing views of Venice. We have also expanded our Family Pool to include an interactive water play fountain where kids can enjoy and use their imagination to create their own inventions with super-sized waterproof foam bricks. The fountain is suited for children of all ages and is a fantastic addition to our kids-friendly area, which features a playground and Adventure Park as well.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
