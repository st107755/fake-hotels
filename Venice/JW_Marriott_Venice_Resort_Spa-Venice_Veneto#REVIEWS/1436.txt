A very new, american-style hotel on Isola Rossa (sp?) off short from Venice.  Very nice and very pricey.  A boubon and seven at the bar was $21, so we didn't drink much.  Maybe that's a good things.  Actually, it's not true.  We bought wine onshore, chilled in the room and enjoyed.  We were there on Marriott points, so the cost was minimal.  The breakfast buffet was stupendous.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 18, 2015Dear Craig,  We would like to thank you for your feedback.
