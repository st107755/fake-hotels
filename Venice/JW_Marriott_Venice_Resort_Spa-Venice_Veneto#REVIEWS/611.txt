It starts with the exclusivity of being on its own private island and the water taxi pulling right up into the hotel. The staff is right there ready to assist with bags and to help your jet lagged brain. The room is especially nice. The breakfast buffet is The best I have ever had. It's always nice to start the day with a little Proseco. Water shuttles run back an forth to Piazza San Marco on the half hour. The reception/concierge staff are extremely helpful and friendly. A side note - our friend left his phone on one of the water taxis, they found it and put it in safe keeping for him. This honest gesture saved his vacation.

We appreciate your kind words about our helpful and friendly staff, nice rooms and delicious breakfast buffet.  We hope you had the chance to check out some of the activities and excursions that we offer at our resort such as our Sapori Cooking Academy, which is a big hit with our guests. The morning program we offer is such an unforgettable experience. The day starts off with meeting our Chef and travelling together via private water taxi to the colorful Rialto Market. He helps you choose the freshest ingredients to take back to the resort where he teaches how to prepare delicious dishes following the Venetian culinary tradition. Plus, you get to enjoy the lunch that you helped prepare. It is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the local culture â€“ I highly recommend it.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
