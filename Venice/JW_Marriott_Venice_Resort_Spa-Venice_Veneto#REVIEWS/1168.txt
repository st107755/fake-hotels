I have to pause from our European tour to give praise to the JW Marriott resort and Spa located in its own private island, Isola de la Rossa.  This beautiful place is a sanctuary outside Piazza San Marco offering breathtaking views of Venice from its rooftop terrace.  White roses spill from every balcony and olive trees demarcate long solitary walking paths. Perhaps, the greatest jewel of this new Marriott resort is its shining staff.  Alessandra and Melania welcomed us on the first day of our stay and bid us "a presto" when we left. Their attention to detail and service was impeccable. Well done, Marriott!  Thank you for a most fantastic stay!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
