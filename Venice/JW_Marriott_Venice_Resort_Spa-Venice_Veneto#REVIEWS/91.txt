We love this place and it's got even better since our last visit. You roll up like James bond in a private water taxi before the excellent Marriott staff take over. They are all friendly multilingual and professional nothing is too much trouble.  We loved staying on this tranquil island and bobbing on their free boat to St Mark's when we wanted to visit Venice.  At home on the island we enjoyed the stunning Sagra dining on the roof, the adults only rooftop pool and the much improved family pool area. Breakfast was overseen by the wonderful Agenda and we sat outside under shade whilst enjoying the amazing buffet. Nutella pizza slice and ice cream?! What a treat . Our room was calm cool and silent we had the best long sleeps there. Already missing the place. Just perfectRead moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
