Wonderful island retreat from the tourist crowds in Venice.  Extremely attentive and friendly staff.  Extra activities for the kids such as playing fields, cotton candy by the pool, and a very nice infinity family pool and pool deck. Highly recommended!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 7, 2016Dear Ann4711, thanks so much for your positive feedback. We are grateful for your generous comments about our wonderful island retreat, attentive and friendly staff and fun activities for kids.  When the team and I were brainstorming the activities for the Kids Club program we wanted to offer something that would incorporate aspects of Italian culture so that the children would get to know the history and traditions of our beautiful country. Some of the activities that we are proud to offer families include Italian language lessons, creating and painting your own mini gondola and making Venetian masks. We hope that your kids had the chance to enjoy the many fun activities that we have, as well as our new Adventure Park and playground located next to the Family Pool.  Thank you for recommending us and we hope to see you again soon!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
