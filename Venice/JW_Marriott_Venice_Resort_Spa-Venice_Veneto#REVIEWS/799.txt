I stay approx 150 nights a year at Marriott properties. The JW Venice is one of the nicest, cleanest, and professionally ran hotels I have stayed at in a very long time. The staff was always willing to go above and beyond to ensure you are enjoying your stay.  The shuttle boat was alway on time and very clan.  The resort grounds are beautiful, the hotel is very peaceful and relaxing, and the three hours we spent in the spa enjoying the pool,sauna, and steam room was great! The highlight of our trip to Venice was taking a 2 hour cooking class with Chef Micki Milan. What an absolute blast we had making ravioli and leaning about local cuisine, restaurants, and food preparation. Chef Micki made us feel at home and very comfortable in his kitchen.

We are grateful for your generous comments about our nice hotel, attentive staff, beautiful grounds, peaceful and relaxing atmosphere and memorable cooking class with Chef Micki.  Many guests tell us that the culinary classes at our Sapori Cooking Academy are one of the top activities to do when in Venice. It really is a wonderful experience. As you experienced, guests learn to prepare a whole menu, ranging from the Venetian tradition to the great classics of Italian cuisine. Not only will you enjoy sampling delicious Italian dishes, you will also be provided with the skills and knowledge so you can prepare them at home.
