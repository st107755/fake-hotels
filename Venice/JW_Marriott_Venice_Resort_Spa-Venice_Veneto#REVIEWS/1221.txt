We thoroughly enjoyed 4 nights in the beauty of the JW Marriott Venice and wish to thank all of the fabulous and hard-working staff for making it so special! The island and the hotel are fantastic, the services are immaculate but what made it extra-special was the welcoming and sincerely warm-hearted attitude of all of the personnel. We can only recommend the JW Marriott Venice and hope to be back one day.
