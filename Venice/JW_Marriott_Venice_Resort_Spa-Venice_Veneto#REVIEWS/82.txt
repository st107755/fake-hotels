Have you ever felt like you could not stand people in crowds anymore in Venice. Stay at the JW Marriott. This hotel is located 20 minutes away from the hustle and bustle of the city. This resort feels plain from the  pictures but when you see it yourself you will be amazed because this hotel is one of the very few hotels on a private Venetian island that has all the things you need to enjoy your stay. Five restaurants, 2 pools, Playground, spa service, fitness center, kids club, and wonderful rooms. I recommend you stay here if you want to feel paradise. JW Marriott will not let you down.
