Picked to stay at the Marriott because of the space. Was so fortunate with the weather and the rooftop pool with the view and the wonderful service was worth the pennies. It's a great spot with very friendly staff and the hotel is immaculate. Breakfast buffet is very good even with brunch courses and tea and coffee served almost immediately which I find can take a long time in most hotel. Overall I was extremely impressed with the resort. You have to pay cover charges, extra for the spa and I think internet isn't free to all guests so these are the slight annoyances. However there is a sauna and steam room in the gym.
