The hotel is absolutely stunning. Everything was clean and they even replaced towels for us twice one day. All of the staff were attentive and polite. The pool on the top desk was gorgeous, it just isn't that big. We enjoyed it, it's just it looks bigger in the pictures. The shuttle from the island ran on time and was a quick ride away from stores and restaurants. We ate in the lounge and the top floor restaurant-both were great!Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 10, 2017Dear kkayo213i, thank you for your wonderful feedback.
