We stayed at the JW Venice and it was fantastic as well as all the staff. It is high season for tourists and it was nice to get away from the crowds and escape. We had dinner last night at Sagra Rooftop Restaurant and Andreea (from Romania) was our server. She did a wonderful job and was very personable and attentive. Thank you for a wonderful experience!Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 11, 2017Dear Darrin H, thanks for your wonderful feedback.
