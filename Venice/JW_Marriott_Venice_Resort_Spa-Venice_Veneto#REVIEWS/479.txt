This gem of a hotel is just magnificent. initially quite difficult to get to (would have been easier had we been able to afford a private water taxi from the Airport) but the location is perfect. The hotel has private transfers between St. Marks Sq and the hotel ever 30mins which is just beyond convenient. The hotel is great to escape the throngs of tourists who descend on Venice every afternoon (from the cruise ships).   The rooftop bar is the perfect place to grab a bite to eat and have a cocktail (or several) whilst watching the sunset over the city across the lagoon.   Typical Marriott style of service with concierge going above and beyond with every question, query and request.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 11, 2017Dear Charles L, thanks for your glowing review.
