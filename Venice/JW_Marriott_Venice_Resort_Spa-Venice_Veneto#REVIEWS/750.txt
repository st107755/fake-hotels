A huge thank you to the whole JW Marriott Venice team! The stay was just unbelievable! The hotel is very well located and it has all you would expect from a 5 star hotel! It also has huge gardens, tranquillity, an amazing rooftop pool which allows you to absorb Venice from 20' distance.  Thank you especially to Valentino, Holland, Alessio, Alexandra!  Suggestions : I suggest that the JW shuttle will start earlier so that early flights can be reachable.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 8, 2017Dear Mihaela U, we are absolutely delighted that you had an unbelievable stay at our resort. We appreciate your kind words about our good location, huge gardens, tranquil atmosphere and amazing rooftop pool.  I agree, our Sagra Rooftop restaurant and pool offers one of the best vantage points to admire breathtaking 360-degree views of Venice and the Lagoon. It is also the ideal place to watch the beautiful Venetian sunset. Many guests tell us how much they enjoy spending Happy Hour there while indulging in a glass of prosecco and some tapas from our Cicchetti Menu. It is an experience not to be missed.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
