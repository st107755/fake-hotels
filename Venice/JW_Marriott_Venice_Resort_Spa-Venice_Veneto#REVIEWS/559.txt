This was an island mirage in what is otherwise a super crowded and touristy city in the middle of hot July - what a fantastic choice for a family of 5, 3 kids.  The single best feature is the ability to travel into and out of Venice and to return to air conditioning, clean rooms etc and rest with he kids.  The family pool area was excellent, although not well advertised which was strange. The service at this hotel was five star front to back, staffed mainly from 18-25 year old local Venetian who were very eager to please , efficient and knowledgeable.  The concierge ( Romeo, Vitoria, Holden) services were the best I've seen as far as local knowledge and their ability to call anyone and book things for you.  The food here was good, although curiously not as Italian as I wouldâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 2, 2017Dear yalmojon, thanks for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our family-friendly atmosphere and five-star service.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our property provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very kids-friendly, with a family pool, interactive water fountain, playground as well as a fun Adventure Park.  Thank you for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
