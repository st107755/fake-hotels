Having said the above, this is a 'resort' so there are no Perks for rewards members other than a room upgrade and wifi. The only other negative thing about the property is the lack of entertainment. It is a sleepy island, although gorgeous. There is no executive lounge or free breakfast. I would recommend a game room and outdoor Corn hole, horse Shoes, Bocci Ball, or other fun activities. The boat leaves every 30mins so a bit of planning is required for dinner in venice and activities. The Spa and Gym are really nice. Really enjoyed the Villa room! I probably would not pay the nightly rate, but it's the best value for 40k points in the whole Marriott chain!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 18, 2016Dear sdtrojan, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We appreciate your kind words about our gorgeous and relaxing resort.  I am also glad to hear that you had the chance to check out our GOCO Spa. It is such a wonderful experience and you can spend the whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
