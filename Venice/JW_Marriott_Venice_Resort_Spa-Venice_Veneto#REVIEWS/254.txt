Our third time at the JW Marriott Venice and no not third time lucky. In fact every time has made us feel lucky. This is an amazing tranquil place that allows you to get away from Venice when you need too. Wonderful staff ( I must mention Giada) who did everything to make the stay special.   The hotel seems to get better every year and the staff seem genuinely really pleasant and happy to serve you.   We are a Marriott member but staff that pass you in corridors or serve you at the pool don’t know that and they treat everyone the same.   Don’t get me wrong there are some great Privileges to being part of their reward scheme, but all visitors are seen as important.  It’s clearly a luxury hotel and prices aren’t low, but you can measure value based on how you feel when you leave…Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
