The JW Marriott is a destination resort located on its own island with easy access to one of the most amazing cities in the world. From the warm and friendly Italian-style welcome at check in to the free shuttle from the island delle Rose (where the hotel is located) to the glories of Venice everything is top notch here. What could be better after a long day of sightseeing than to return to the calm and tranquillity of the JW? Only that one can also have a relaxing swim, stroll the olive grove, or just chill in a room outfitted with a complementary espresso machine before dining at their one star Michelin restaurant, Dopolavoro. Love this hotel; can't wait to return. Also love the Marriott Rewards program which allowed me to stay here for 3 nights on reward points!Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 9, 2016Dear loveitaly10, thanks so much for writing a review.
