Venice is too crowded and congested. Staying here is a true oasis. Everything is five star. The food is outstanding. The staff is incredible. They are pleasant, efficient and always available but never in your face. I cannot conceive of staying anyplace else should I return to Venice. There is complementary regular boat service to the commotion should it be desired.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 30, 2016Dear Bruce F, thanks so much for your positive feedback. We appreciate your kind comments about our fabulous resort, outstanding food and incredible staff.  I agree with your sentiment about our private island being an oasis right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort. Some guests even tell us that on some days they donâ€™t leave our island!  Thank you for choosing JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
