Very relaxing. Ideal place for rest to get away from the crowds of Venice.  The hotel is on its own island with all facilities - swimming pool, fitness centre and several restaurants. As a family we found this place ideal as we had the best of both worlds as the hotel provides a free shuttle service to st marks square every 30 minutes. St marks square is 20 minutes away with the shuttle.

We appreciate your kind words about our beautiful resort. I sympathize with your comments about our Isola delle Rose being the best of both worlds. Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as an amazing Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
