Marriott Venice Resort is about a year old and is located on its own private island and requires taking a private boat shuttle which runs on the half hour to and from San Marco and the main Venice attractions. Arriving from the airport, it is most time efficient but costly to take a privately arranged taxi for about 130 Euros to the resort which takes about 50 minutes.  You arrange transit through the hotel, and then check into a desk near baggage area to get a slip which shows you the specific dock location and boat number.  Please note the walk to the docks was a long 15 minutes and there is construction being done to the airport.

We hope the next time you visit us you will be able to take advantage of the diverse activity program that we offer at the resort.  When the team and I were organizing the activities and excursions that we wanted to provide our guests, we thought of all the things that would be part of the ultimate travel experience of Italy. From interactive cooking classes to a tour of a traditional Murano glass-making factory, we wanted to showcase our passion for Italy and highlight some of the wonderful and fascinating aspects of its culture and history.   We also appreciate any feedback that will help us enhance our offering. I have discussed your suggestions with the team and we are looking into the areas where we can improve.  Thank you for choosing to stay at our Isola delle Rose and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
