I want to first say that the resort and their staff are great but that isn't everything. This is a resort  so I would expect the rooms to be a little nicer. The food at the rooftop bar was great but you are charged €8 per person for just sitting down. I am aware that local places charge a "cover charge" but it's usually €2 or less. There were 3 of us and it was €26 added to out dinner bill. I am not a penny pincher but don't want to just throw money away but that was the feeling I got with this excessive fee.  Getting to the island can be pricy as well. We arrived in the evening and had to take a private water taxi. That taxi costs €140 per trip and an additional €10 per person. In conversion terms that is about $168 for a taxi. I also had to pay that leaving.

First of all, we would like to thank you for having chosen us and we are glad that you overall enjoyed the Resort and the customer service extended by our associates. At the same time, we regret that the room assigned did not fully satisfy and meet your preference, as that you found some of our pricing, including the cover charge at the restaurant and the private water taxi cost, excessive.  In regards of the cover charge, we would like to clarify that -as mentioned in your review- it is a local Italian charge present in all restaurants, not only in luxury properties, which basically replaces the typical mandatory gratuity for the service present in some countries, such as in the United States. The amount of this charge may vary depending on the type of restaurant, as it does not have a fixed valued. However, we have brought your comment to the attention of our Food & Beverage Management Team aiming to enhance our guests' experience and to drive our guests' satisfaction towards the highest level.   We hope to welcoming you back again in the nearest future.  Kindest regards,  Erica Travan Front Office Manager Erica.travan@jwmarriotthotels.comRead more
