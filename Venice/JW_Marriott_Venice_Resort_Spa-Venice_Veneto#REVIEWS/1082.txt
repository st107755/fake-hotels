We are grateful for your kind comments about our beautiful and relaxing property, helpful staff, delicious breakfast, gorgeous grounds and amazing views.  I think Venice is an ideal location to establish a base for an Italian or European trip. Our airport is the third biggest in the country with connections to almost every single cosmopolitan city in the world and direct flights to several cities in Europe. As you mentioned, the train system can take you to Milan, Rome, Florence or even as south as Napoli. We always encourage our customers to spend at least five nights at our resort and have a vacation within a vacation – we are so glad that you had the chance to spend almost a week at our magical Isola delle Rose.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
