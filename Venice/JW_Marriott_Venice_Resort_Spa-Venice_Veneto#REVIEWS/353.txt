We chose to stay at the JWMarriott due to the Heavy traffic expected in Venice and thoroughly enjoyed the decision.  Quiet and beautiful buildings and grounds made for a tranquil getaway.  The Spa is one of the best Iâ€™ve experienced.  Also had the pleasure of meeting one of the local staff, Daniil Reznikov, who is doing his internship here at the resort.  Excellent service and staff here.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
