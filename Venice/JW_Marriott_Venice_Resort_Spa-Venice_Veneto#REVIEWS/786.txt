This Marriott may be one of the nicest properties in the entire Marriott portfolio.  Located on its own private island just a short (inclusive) boat ride away from Venice's main attractions.  The resort is inclusive of a heated rooftop pool offering amazing views of Venice and surrounding islands.  The food although expensive was spectacular and so was the Micheline Star restaurant also nestled on the property next to the gardens and mature olive trees.  A morning walk with a cappuccino prior to making your way to Venice proper was just amazing.  I will never forget the service of the front desk however, the concierge could be a bit more well versed in local attractions.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Dec 22, 2016Dear Louis G, thank you for taking the time to write a review. We are thrilled to hear you say that our Isola delle Rose is one of the nicest properties in the Marriott portfolio that you have experienced. We are grateful for your kind comments about our amazing views, spectacular food and beautiful grounds.  I hope you had the chance to check out our GOCO Spa. It is such a wonderful experience and you can spend a whole day there getting pampered and enjoying the mesmerizing views of the Lagoon. Our spa – the largest in Venice – also features a spectacular Himalayan Salt Wall, which not only adds an earthy and tranquil beauty to the space but also promotes cleaner and fresher air through its natural purifying abilities. This in turn has a number of health benefits such as better digestion and sleep as well as positive effects on emotional wellbeing. We always encourage our guests to visit our spa after a busy day in Venice to relax and unwind.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
