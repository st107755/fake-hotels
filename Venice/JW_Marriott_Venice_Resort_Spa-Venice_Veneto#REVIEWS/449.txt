Pros:  -Beautiful resort -Huge rooms (especially for Europe),  -Nice, modern bathrooms -Amazing views of Venice from some rooms and many areas around resort -Excellent breakfast (you may have to pay extra depending on your situation) -Beautiful rooftop bar and infinity pool  -Staff is friendly and very professional -Private island (can see this as a pro or con - great to get away from all of the people in Venice but it takes some time to get to and from the sights)  Cons:  -Water taxi leaves for resort every 30 minutes so you may end up waiting a little based on timing and how full the shuttles are -Depending on where you arrive from, it may be a hike (or expensive trip) to get you and your luggage to San Marco Square where the shuttle takes you to the hotel -PriceyRead moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 22, 2017Dear Ariel B, thanks for your glowing review. We appreciate your generous comments about our beautiful property, huge rooms, amazing views, excellent breakfast, gorgeous rooftop bar and friendly staff.  As you mentioned, our Sagra Rooftop restaurant and pool offers one of the best vantage points to admire breathtaking 360-degree views of Venice and the Lagoon. It is also the ideal place to watch the beautiful Venetian sunset. Many guests tell us how much they enjoy spending Happy Hour there while indulging in a glass of prosecco and some tapas from our Cicchetti Menu. It is an experience not to be missed.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
