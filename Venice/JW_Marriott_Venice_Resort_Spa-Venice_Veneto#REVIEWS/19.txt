I stayed at the JW Marriot in Venice for 3 nights and I absolutely enjoyed it. It is a great 5* hotel located on a small island just outside of Venice and the connection to the city is by frequent boat rides. The room was the best part of the experience: big, luxurious and tastefully decorated. The staff was very friendly and well trained and the breakfast delicious. Highly recommended for an unforgettable stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
