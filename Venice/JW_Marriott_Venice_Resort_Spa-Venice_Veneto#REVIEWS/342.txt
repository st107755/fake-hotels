From the very beginning, the JW Marriott was top notch. Landing in Venice airport, we were picked up on a private boat to the Isle of JW Marriott. The entrance/ arrival to the hotel via its water entrance was impressive. The staff was wonderful and very kind. The hotel encompasses the entire island and the property is lovely. There is a free shuttle that takes you back and forth to the main island of Venice as well as the train station. We loved this property and would definitely return!!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
