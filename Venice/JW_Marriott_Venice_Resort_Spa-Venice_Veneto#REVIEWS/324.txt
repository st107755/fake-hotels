 My family spent 4 nights at the JW Venice in May 2018.  This resort does require a boat transfer to arrive in Venice.  The transfers happen every 30 mins (leaving the island or San Marco square).  The transportation is very efficient and on-time.  The hotel sits on its own island.  The hotel staff is very attentive and responsive (similar to Peninsula or Four Seasons properties).  The hotel offers multiple restaurants and numerous room service options.  The food and beverage costs are quite high, but that should be expected as you are on an island!  The rooms are modern and come with the modern amenities someone should expect in this level of hotel.  Pros:  Great service, food, beautiful island to relax on and get away from a busy Venice during your stay  Cons:  Family poolâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
