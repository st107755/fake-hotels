My wife and I just returned from a marvelous trip to Venice, Italy.  It was our 24th time in Venice and it was a memorable one.  It was the first time we stayed at the J W Marriott's new resort and spa located on Isola Delle Rose.  The staff was professional and extremely friendly.  The head of guest relations, Claudia, was a delight.  We also met a young lady in the dining room, Laura, who made our experience even better.  The wine steward at DopoLavoro, Simone, was also terrific.  We took a wine experience class with him and really enjoyed it.  Our guide for the gondola making tour was Marco, and we could not have had a better tour guide.  We became instant friends.  The accommodations were exceptionable and the experience one we will always remember.
