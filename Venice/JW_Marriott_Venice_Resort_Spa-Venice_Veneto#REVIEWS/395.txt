The hotel is located on an island in the bay and was originally a mental health hospital. The main feature of the hotel is its amazing panorama of Venice from the common outdoor restaurant and pool. Our room had the same panorama but no terrace so I would not again pay extra for the room with a view (of Venice). Because it is located on a island you have to take a free water taxi back and forth to Venice. Dropoff and pickup point is 5 minutes walk from the Doge's palace and trip time is 20-30 minutes. Luxury resort with all the corresponding service and amenities. We ate only breakfast at the hotel which was very nice. Great location to take pictures of sunset on Venice, but during the night Venice is too dark for great pictures.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 20, 2017Dear MarcATL, thanks for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our luxury hotel, amazing views and nice amenities.  Our Isola delle Rose – Island of Roses – has a rich history. Its position, halfway between the lagoon and sea, has given the island a special microclimate, which has encouraged the growth of plants and trees rare in Venice and inspired the establishment of a clinic of respiratory ailments at the beginning of the 20th century. We are proud of the historical roots of our private island and love to share the beauty of our grounds with our guests.  Thanks for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
