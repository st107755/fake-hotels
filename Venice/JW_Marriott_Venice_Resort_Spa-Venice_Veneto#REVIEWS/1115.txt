Great expansive resort with easy shuttle boat to Venice/St Marks square. Sits on its own island. Excellent resort grounds and play area for kids. They offer paid shuttle too from airport which is super expensive. Instead opt for round-trip to St Mark's square from airport. From St Mark's dock , J W Marriott offers free shuttle to the resort/from the resort! Breakfast is very good. Roof-top restaurant is excellent but expensive.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 13, 2016Dear RaghuSN, thanks for your wonderful feedback. We are grateful for your kind comments about our amazing resort, convenient shuttle service, excellent grounds and delicious restaurants.  Did you have the chance to explore our private island by bicycle? One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our historical gardens. It really is a fun and memorable way to enjoy our Isola delle Rose.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
