This is a new hotel, and like all new hotels it has a few problems. I stayed for 3 nights and had two rooms, one room had great AC and the other room had none. I heard from some of the other guests that they had no water. The staff told me they had a water supply problem, but when I left it had not be resolved. The boat ride is ok - its sometimes seems like it takes a half hour to get to the hotel. the island is beautiful though. Staff service is not as polished as I have seen in other JW's. Chalk it up to opening jitters. I would stay again after time has passed to get better training to the staff.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 31, 2015Dear John,  We would like to thank you for the time you spent in sharing your feedback; we are sorry if you have experienced some issues during your stay, and we apologize for this.
