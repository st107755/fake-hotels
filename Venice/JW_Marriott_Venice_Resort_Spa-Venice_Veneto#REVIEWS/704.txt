Our family loved the JW Marriott in Venice. The fact that it is on a separate island provided a luxurious and peaceful get-away from the crowds in old Venice. The rooftop pool is lovely with amazing views. Each staff member we met was helpful and friendly. Breakfast buffet is a bit pricey but offers a very good selection of food. The free water shuttle to/from Venice is convenient with trips every half hour. It takes 20 minutes to get to/from the hotel to San Marco pier, but we felt the experience at the JW was worth it.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 29, 2017Dear kmschawo, thanks for taking the time to write a review. We are delighted that you and your family had a wonderful time at our magical Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your kind comments about our peaceful island, lovely rooftop pool, amazing views and friendly staff.   I agree, I think one of the main benefits of staying on your own private island is the serene retreat our resort provides after a busy day in Venice. Venice is certainly an exciting and thrilling destination, with its vibrant culture and rich history as well as the hustle and bustle of its crowded streets but many of our guests tell us that they like being able to come back to our relaxing hotel after a full day on the main island.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
