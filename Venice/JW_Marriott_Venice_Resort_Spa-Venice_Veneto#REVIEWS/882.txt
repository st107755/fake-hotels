Very nice place. A resort to rest from Venezia crowds. Gardens, spa, gym, church, playground, docks among other amenities form a complete relaxing experience in a historical and also minimalist hotel ambience.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 22, 2016Dear GSG1972, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate your generous comments about our nice resort and thoughtful amenities.  Did you have the chance to explore our private island by bicycle? One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with friends, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
