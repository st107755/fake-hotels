From the greeting at the water taxi dock to the staff persons who prepared  the room, each person was personable, well informed about the resort, provided excellent incite into making our stay most enjoyable.

We appreciate your generous comments about our personable and well-informed staff, expertly prepared food and impeccable customer service.  We hope you had the chance to check out some of the activities and excursions that we offer at our resort such as our Sapori Cooking Academy, which is a big hit with our guests. The morning program we offer is such an unforgettable experience. The day starts off with meeting our Chef and travelling together via private water taxi to the colorful Rialto Market. He helps you choose the freshest ingredients to take back to the resort where he teaches how to prepare delicious dishes following the Venetian culinary tradition. Plus, you get to enjoy the lunch that you helped prepare. It is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the local culture – I highly recommend it.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
