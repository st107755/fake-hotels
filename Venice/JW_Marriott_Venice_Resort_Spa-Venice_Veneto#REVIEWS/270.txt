We had a fabulous night with the sunset at the rooftop restaurant, Sagra. Teo was our waiter and so friendly and helpful. What a great way to spend our evening!! We had antipasti, primo and secondi.... all delicious, courtesy of Teoâ€™s recommendations. Have a Veneto Spritz and enjoy the sunset!!Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
