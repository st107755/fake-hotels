We stayed at the JW Marriott after a cruise - we arrived via a private taxi and had a wonderful greeting, and check in.  The staff were fantastic and very welcoming, especially the girls on the reception check in - we ate on the roof top restaurant, and were really well looked after by Maria - to be honest, the staff throughout the while resort were very friendly, and the garden room we had was fantastic with its own private garden.
