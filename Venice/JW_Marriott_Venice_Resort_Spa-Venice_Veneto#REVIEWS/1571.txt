New hotel with a small bump or two in the road that was handled by the mgr on duty.the mgr wants his clients to have a great vacation. Any request was handled in Timmy an easy manner.   I also have to say the restaurant that is a short walk from main hotel section was the highlight of the trip. Perfect service and food un matched. Hats off to the chef, all the service staff and mgr. We are still talking about are special night out with friends and family.   Great roof top pool, kids enjoyed the late afternoons by the pool and the food on the upstairs terrace.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
