I had absolutely no idea what to expect from the JW Marriott when my wife recommended this hotel.  First, the staff went above and beyond accommodating our requests while we were there.  Our villa was one of the nicest vacation accommodations we have enjoyed.  The privacy of the island is a good break from the busyness that is Venice in the summer.  The 20 minute boat ride from St. Mark's Square will give you time to relax and enjoy the view.  The island itself is peaceful and relaxing.  This is a great choice when considering your options for Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 16, 2017Dear ENSDrRich4BNA, thanks for your positive feedback.
