Its a nice luxury hotel.  The staff is extremely good looking and sometimes has a vibe of being an exclusive night club because everyone is so beautiful.  The problem with the hotel is that its a "cheap" luxury hotel.  When a hotel charges a cover fee for eating or drinking at the restaurant, its a bit silly.  I would prefer that the hotel include it in the food charge (which is already high), but its one of principle.  When a luxury hotel starts to nickel-and-dime everyone, it's no longer a luxury hotel.  Its like sitting in business class on an airline and being charged for food and drinks.  At that point, its no longer really business class.  So this so-called luxury hotel isn't that great.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 15, 2017Dear AnonTraveler11, thank you for writing a review. We appreciate your kind words about our beautiful hotel and staff. However, I am very sorry to hear that you were disappointed with some aspects of your experience.  With regards to your comment on the cover charge at our restaurants, it is a very common charge in many dining establishments and hotels in Italy. This ‘coperto’ can be compared to a set-up fee for the table and also includes bread. Having said this, the satisfaction of our guests is our highest priority so I welcome you to contact our Director of Room Operations, Anna Gutova, to discuss your stay in more detail. You can email her on info.venice@jwmarriotthotels.com.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
