We will be spending three days at the JW in late October.  How difficult is is to get there from the train station and then leave to get a rental car.  Should we get a car there in Venice or go to the air port?  Also, does the hotel have a concierge floor with evening appetizers?Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 10, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for your comment; our Concierge is at disposal of the guests in order to assist them in organizing private transfers from the train station straight to the Resort. We suggest to contact him by e-mail (concierge.venice@jwmarriotthotels.com) to receive indications and quotations for this service. Please kindly note that it is necessary to send the exact details of the train (train number, city of departure and arrival time).  In addition to this, it is necessary to enjoy our complimentary shuttle service from and to St. Mark's Square. To reach St. Mark's Square from the train station via vaporetto public transportation, the best option is line nÂ° 1 to San Marco Vallaresso where you can get on our complimentary shuttle service. The Hotel private pier in Venice is located just in front of the Royal Gardens, very close to the vaporetto stop.   For your departure, car rentals are available at Piazzale Roma in Venice; it is possible to reach Piazzale Roma from our island via private water taxi or, in some period of the days, we offer complimentary shuttle service straight to Piazzale Roma, early in the morning.  We thank you for your kind attention and truly look forward to welcoming you to Venice!  Sincerest regards,  Linda Bertoni Marketing & Communication ManagerRead more
