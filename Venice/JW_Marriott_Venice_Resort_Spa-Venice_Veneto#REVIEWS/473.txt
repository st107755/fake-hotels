We appreciate your kind words about our lovely resort and nice breakfast. However, I am very sorry to hear about the concerns you expressed regarding your last stay with us.   We have thoroughly investigated the matter, but our efforts have not led to the recovery of your items, nor uncovered any evidence indicating the cause of your loss. Under these circumstances, we have no alternative but to disclaim liability for the loss you sustained, since there is no evidence to indicate that your loss resulted from the negligence of the hotel.   I realize that you are far more interested in a recovery than in an explanation or an apology, but in view of the circumstances with which we are both familiar, the hotel is unable to compensate you for the loss you experienced.   We have enjoyed your patronage in the past, and we hope to serve you again in the future. Thank you again for bringing this matter to my attention, and if you have any questions with regard to the position we are required to take in this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.   Sincerely, Enrique Tasende, General ManagerRead more
