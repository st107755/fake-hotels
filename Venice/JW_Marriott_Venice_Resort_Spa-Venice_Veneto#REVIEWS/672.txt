We've just returned from a long weekend at the JW Marriott Venice. It was perfect in every way, with exceptional customer service throughout the hotel. Eating at Dopolovoro is a must, and it is well worth visiting the family pool, even without children. The private water taxi to and from the airport is well worth the money and makes for a really special start and end to the trip. Travelling into Venice is easy with the free shuttle every half hour. In many ways it felt like two holidays, with the culture and buzz of Venice combined with the luxury and peace of the JW Marriott. We will be back!Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jun 7, 2017Dear katiefrost123, thank you for your glowing review. We are delighted to hear that your stay with us was perfect in every way. We are grateful for your kind comments about our exceptional customer service and easy shuttle service.  We hope you had the chance to explore our private island by bicycle. One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with friends, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
