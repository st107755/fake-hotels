We spent a week at this hotel and it was totally worth it. They might be away from the city but they offer shuttle service quite often during the day and night. There is a timetable so just plan accordingly! We stayed in La Residenza Pool Suite. The room amenities and the pool were great! Don't expect a huge pool for swim team lol. Its cosy and it worked. Breakfast was good! Their omelet was to die for, maybe i get into trouble for saying it's the best lol. Though, I didn't get a chance to view it, I hear the rooftop bar is great, especially when the sunsets. It's a great escape after the hustle and bustle in the city.   Service was great and the staff quite attentive. Go ahead, you won't regret it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
