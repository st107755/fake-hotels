My husband and I had a wonderful evening cooking pasta dishes with Chef Mickey Milan.   We laughed, leaned many tips, helped with preparation and then got to eat the most fresh delicious pasta dishes for our evening meal.  What could be better?  I would suggest this for anyone who comes to this destination resort.  The wait staff at breakfast - especially Laura, Kiki and Arian -- were attentive and helpful in every way.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 30, 2016Dear Mary H, thanks so much for your review. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed participating in one of Chef Mickiâ€™s culinary courses. Many of our guests tell us how much they recommend this fun and engaging class.  We hope that you were able to check out some of the other activities that we offer at our resort. When the team and I were organizing the excursions that we wanted to provide our guests, we thought of all the things that would be part of the ultimate travel experience of Italy. From interactive cooking classes to a tour of a traditional Murano glass-making factory, we wanted to showcase our passion for Italy and highlight some of the wonderful and fascinating aspects of its culture and history.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
