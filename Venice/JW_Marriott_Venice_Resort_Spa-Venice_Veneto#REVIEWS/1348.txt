Incredible, stunning location! Beautiful island with old and new buildings, including a chapel and spa, with large hotel with everything you going wish for. Roof top pool (small) with amazing choy views across the lagoon to Venice, a bigger family pool ticked away on the grounds. If you have breakfast included it is fantastic, endless choice and all delicious. Shuttle waterbus to Venice pootles along but is a fun part of the trip, and so nice to escape the bustle once you're done sightseeing. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
