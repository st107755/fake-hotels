What a spectacular resort. Sagra is such a great rooftop restaurant the views are incredible. Kids Club was spectacular in that the kids actually wanted to be there. making masks and gondolas was the tops. Lugi and Marco at the family pool were great. Only negative was that we couldn't get connecting rooms as our kids are 10,10 and 11 this was a bit of a logistical problem. 100% we will be back next year.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 10, 2016Dear David G, thanks so much for your review. We really appreciate your kind feedback about our spectacular resort, incredible views at our rooftop restaurant and fun Kids Club.  When the team and I were brainstorming the activities for the Kids Club program, we wanted to offer something that would incorporate aspects of Italian culture so that the children would get to know the history and traditions of our beautiful country. As you mentioned, some of the activities that we are proud to offer families include creating and painting your own mini gondola and making Venetian masks, just to name a few!   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
