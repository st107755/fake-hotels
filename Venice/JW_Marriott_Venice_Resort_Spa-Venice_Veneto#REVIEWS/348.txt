We had a wonderful stay at the JW.  The property is beautiful and it is nice to have a relaxing get away after exploring Venice during the day and/or night.  The boat ride is nice from the JW to Venice.  It is only 20 minutes and goes back and forth every 1/2 hour.  The service at the hotel was great. The server, Turgut, in the Rosebar was wonderful.  The setting on the 4th floor of the hotel is amazing.  The pool area and restaurant has a beautiful view of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
