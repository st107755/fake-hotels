Even with some rainy days we had a great time. The rooms are confortable and clean.  Free shuttles to Venice every 30 min. I only wish it was closer to downtown because you may want to come and go thru the day. On another had you don't have to deal with crowded streets around as is alone in island with awesome roof top view of 360   Good food and service.
