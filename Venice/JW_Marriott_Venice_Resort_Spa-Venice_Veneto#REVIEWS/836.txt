We visited for 3 days and had a wonderful time.  We signed up for one of the cooking classes and had the opportunity to go to the market with Chef Samuel, followed by a brief tour of the Venice, and then several hours in the kitchen cooking and eating.  What a treat!  The views were amazing, the rooms was perfect, and the island was relaxing.  Next time we'll remember to pick up some of the olive oil made from the olive trees outside our room.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 24, 2016Dear Candace M, thank you for taking the time to write a review. We appreciate your kind comments about our amazing views, perfect rooms, relaxing atmosphere and our wonderful cooking classes offered at the Sapori Cooking Academy.  You may be interested to hear that we are currently picking and harvesting our olives found on our beautiful Isola delle Rose for next season’s olive oil. I definitely recommend taking a few bottles back home with you the next time you visit us – it is such a lovely reminder of your time with us. We hope that you had the chance to taste our exclusive olive oil at our Michelin-starred restaurant, Dopolavoro.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.
