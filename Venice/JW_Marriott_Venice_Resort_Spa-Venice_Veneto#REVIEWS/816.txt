Situated about 20-30 minutes from San Marco, the JW Marriott Venice Hotel provides impeccable service in a modern sleek luxurious environment.  The sprawling property offers plenty of venue space for social and corporate events, an outstanding gym and spa with panoramic views of the water. No wonder I encountered business people, families, young and old couples. There's an old church onsite and several restaurants to select from along with a culinary school.  With free shuttle back and forth running every 30 minutes, this is a wonderful place to vacation or indulge.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 2, 2016Dear VictoriaEvents, thanks so much for your positive feedback.

His main focus was to integrate the contemporary elements of the existing buildings to showcase their unique history and personality, while at the same time enhancing the architectural heritage of our location.  Thank you for choosing to stay at the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
