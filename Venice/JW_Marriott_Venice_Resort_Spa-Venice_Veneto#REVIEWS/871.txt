Located on an island 15-20 mins from San Marco, the Marriott offers all the amenities of a modern hotel. To my taste it is way too modern and lacks the charm that most visitors seek when coming to Venice. Of course, the rooms are very modern and efficient, the service quick (despite the size of the hotel) and the grounds around the hotel well maintained (special mention for an ex-church that now can be used for dinners or parties!) and the arrival (directly from the motoscafo to reception) quite spectacular.  But, in my opinion, it is a good hotel for conventions or business meeting but not for Venice loversRead moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 29, 2016Dear Elliot B, thank you for writing a review. We are grateful for your positive comments about our quick customer service, well-maintained hotel and spectacular arrival experience. However, I am very disappointed to hear that we did not exceed your expectations at this time.   As you mentioned our resort is unique in the sense that it is located on its own private island, which is only a short boat ride away from Venice proper. Many of our guests tell us that they really enjoy the combination of accessibility to Venice and the peace and seclusion that our hotel offers after a full day of sightseeing. Being able to provide this oasis of calm is what makes us special and why many of our guests who are frequent visitors of Venice decide to stay with us time and time again.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope that you will consider visiting us again in the future.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
