Set on its own island, the hotel will pick you up from the airport by private speedboat (cost involved) which is the perfect "James Bond" style way top get to the aiport.  They do a more public service which takes a lot longer but is complimentary.  Beautiful rooms, clean and fresh, modern reception and bar.  The best part has to be the rooftop pool, bar and restaurant.  You need to be up early to bag a lounger by the pool but they come available throughout the day.  Prices are 5 star but the view and the experience is worth it.  We ate in the restaurant for the birthday meal which was delicious and presented with a cake for pudding!  Complimentary water taxi into Venice itself right outside the hotel which took around 30 minutes.    Hotel is expensive...it's 5 star of course - â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
