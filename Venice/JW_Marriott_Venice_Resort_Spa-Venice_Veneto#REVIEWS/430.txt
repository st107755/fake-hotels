The hotel is very clean.  The rooftop has a bar, restaurant and pool area that you can look out into the city across the water.  The staff is friendly and always ask to help with anything.  We came in with a taxi.  The shuttle to the square leaves every 30 minutes on the dot to go to the square and leaves the square every 30 minutes.  I am surprised that they don't have a shuttle that takes people to the train station.  A personal taxi can cost up to $90 to take one from the hotel to the train station.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 16, 2017Dear Laretta H, thanks for your review. We are grateful for your generous comments about our clean hotel, friendly staff and convenient shuttle service.  As you mentioned, our Sagra Rooftop restaurant and pool offers one of the best vantage points to admire breathtaking 360-degree views of Venice and the Lagoon. It is also the ideal place to watch the beautiful Venetian sunset. Many guests tell us how much they enjoy spending Happy Hour there while indulging in a glass of prosecco and some tapas from our Cicchetti Menu. It is an experience not to be missed.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
