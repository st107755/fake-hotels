Beautiful over price resort without the kitchen or wait staff to handle lunch and dinner. Patrons should not have to go to the bar or kitchen ( yes, chef in the kitchen) begging for service or no food after one and 1 1/2 hours ordering. Lunch five tables walked one day and at dinner four tables left the dinning room after long waits and no food. Front desk staff has attitude and make you feel like a nobody . So much for Platium Premier for life. As I was told only Amerucsns care about those cards or status. They need to rethink their allotment of staff.
