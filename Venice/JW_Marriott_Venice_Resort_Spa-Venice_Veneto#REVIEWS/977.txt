We spent one month here and it's wonderful ! Nothing to complain ! We have a six years old and a two months old , choose loft type with garden , plenty of space for a family with two children , two bathrooms and a big and comfortable garden . If requested the cleaning is done at a convenient time . We asked to have the room cleaned before 11 and it was so every day.  The kids club is excellent , the ladies are very good , they connect with the children and create a beautiful relation . Thank u Carlotta , Teresa and all of u! The breakfast was perfect every morning ! Thank u Laura , Andreea , Cristina , Madalina and all.. We were greeted every morning and asked if we need anything by Arian and Gianfranco ! Really felt like home!

We are absolutely delighted that you and your family enjoyed your month-long stay at our magical Isola delle Rose. We appreciate your generous comments about our excellent Kids Club, delicious food, friendly and happy staff and well-manicured island.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. As you mentioned, our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as an amazing Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
