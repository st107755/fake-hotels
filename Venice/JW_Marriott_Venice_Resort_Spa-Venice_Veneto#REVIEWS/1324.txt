I am staying here at the end of the season and the service is better than I have ever seen at a Marriott or Ritz. The property is a great addition to Venice. The property is a quiet respite from the hu bub on Venice . Quiet and restful with a great ferry ride every 30 minutes or so, The hotel is new and does not have the hick ups of other start ups . Kudos to the manager Paul Downing. You are training them well . No snooty Italian service here. Nicola Girardi in the bar was a special person and could he mix a proper Patron Cosmo , Oh H---L yes. Claudia Favaretto was very special in taking care of us at every turn. No stoned left unturned. I love this place. Yes , the spa is great. Now for the rooms , the 700's are out of this world nd the rest are just as great . If you can ,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
