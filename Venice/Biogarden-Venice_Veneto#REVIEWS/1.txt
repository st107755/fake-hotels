We had a reservation at rainbow garden mestre and when we arrived here we were shocked. The spiders and ants were everywere,  the smell is unbarable, the kitchen is unhealthy with dead snails, furniture very old and smelly, the plaster was falling from the walls. The doors are not closing well and exists the risc of animals like frogs to come in. We really consider to sleep in the parking in our car. This is not what i saw on your site and the price was not cheap. At 130 Euros for 2 nights i expected at least not to be affraid that i will sleep with insects in the bed. Also the tv was very old and not working. How is it possible that this facility to have authorisation?!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015Trip type: Traveled as a coupleHelpfulShare
