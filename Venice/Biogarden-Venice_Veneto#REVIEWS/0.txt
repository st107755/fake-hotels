Driving into "Ecogarden" As it calls itself, on the signs, It looks like a cute farm stay place. But what a disorganised place it is, Like a total shambles. Our room was nice,,,,,,,But then the electricity failed on the whole place,,, So we went for a short bike ride on the "FREE BIKES"  But Hmmm Most are highly illegal, no proper working brakes etc,, So at your peril.  Anyway, its a nice area to ride around, Just bring some bike service tools !  On return we had electricity again, But the internet only works in the office area,, But its fine there.  Hot water,,,, Well we had none at all, So no shower, Had clean teeth only  We have stayed in many budget places around 15 to 30 Euros, Tons better than this, But then this is fairly local to Mestre & Venice, So they get away with it. Security,,,,,AL ROOMS USE THE SAME KEY, BE WARNEDâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2017LocationServiceSleep QualityTrip type: Traveled as a coupleHelpfulShare
