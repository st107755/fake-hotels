Lovely garden, lovely people. Near a busstation, so you can easy go to venice. De camping has a cool swimming pool. The host, maurizo is doing his very best to make your stay a plezant stay! We really relaxed there! It was very very nice. Lot of musquitos tough, but yeah, thats italy.  Btw, there is also a kitchen where you can cook your own meel with biological vegies from the garden! :DRead moreDate of stay: August 2014Trip type: Traveled as a coupleHelpfulShare
