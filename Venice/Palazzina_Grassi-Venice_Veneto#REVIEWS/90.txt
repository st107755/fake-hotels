We chose PalazzinaG as our hotel to stay in for our wedding at the Town Hall in Venice. From the outset the Team have been  exemplary . We were helped with our wedding plans by Silvia and nothing was too much trouble  from arranging our lunch at the hotel to organising flower arrangements and transport .   The staff were attentive throughout our stay and were warm and helpful at all times . The tasting menu we had for our wedding lunch was superb and the Terrace is an excellent place to enjoy a meal .   The central location of the hotel meant that it was extremely convenient to access all locations around the city . A vaparetto stop is a minute away making travel around the city straightforward .   A big thank you to the Team and we will definitely be visiting again .Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
