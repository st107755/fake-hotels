Everything about our stay was great. The staff was wonderful - friendly and helpful. The airline lost one of our bags and the hotel staff helped track it down, kept us informed  via text with any updates and ultimately delivered it to our room. They were also wonderful with arranging tranportation to the airport at 4am for a very early flight.  Ate in the restaurant one night which was very good.  Our room had a large balcony which was great for sitting at night and enjoying cocktails. Even though there were many others staying at the hotel, the room was very quiet.
