Stayed with my wife for 3 nights in July. Room was great (though a little on the small side) Lots of mirrors in the room make it very nice but not much room for clothes. On the positive, the hotel is very boutique with only a handful of rooms. Nothing is too much trouble but it does come at a price. You choose your breakfast the night before and the time you want it but it is quite pricey ranging from 13 to 40 euros per person. (13 buys you tea and croissants, with juice) To have it in your room costs an additional 10 euros which is quite amazing considering there is no distance to travel with the food. A pot of tea is 8 euros and if they organise your taxi to the airport they charge a lot onto of the price you can book yourself. Bed was very comfortable and bathroom was greatâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
