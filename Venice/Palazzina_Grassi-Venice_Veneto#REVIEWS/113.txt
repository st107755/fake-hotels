We loved our stay here over New Year's Eve. The hotel was a real home away from home - cosy, friendly, hip, well located and relaxing. We were lucky enough to experience their new year's eve party and it was the best new year's we've ever had. A great place for a honeymoon!Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare
