The staff are very helpful and welcoming. The location is very nice, a kind of a hidden gem very close to some big touristic points and yet off the beaten path. The restaurant and the Krug lounge are amazing. The rooms are comfortable with a great decor, even if some elements are very scenographic but not much functional. Overall, the hotel does not offer as much as other 5 star hotelsRead moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
