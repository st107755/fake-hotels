We have stayed at Grand Canal suite in the middle of "Carnavale"….which was one of the best thing we have ever done in all our travelings. You really experience life in Venice. Quiet tucked away with your own private entrance, private breakfast area, great balcony right on the great canal….Most courteous staff ever which really came through after we left and realized that we had left a package at a restaurant a day before. The hotel staff followed it up arranged for a pick up as well as couriering to us. Special Party for the Carnavale was truly special. We will be back .Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
