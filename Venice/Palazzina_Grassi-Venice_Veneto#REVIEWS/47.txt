Wrong choice for this Hotel, firstly we took the private water taxi from train station to Hotel, arrived the back tower of the Hotel and wait a long time for someone open the back door.  Secondly, the room is so small with the overpriced room rate, bad smell from outside and the lighting system was horrible that suddenly all light switch on at midnight. And you can't control your own room temperature (need to call room service to control) but still hot after called.  Totally, I can't believed this Hotel is one of Starwood group, it would the worst one of this group.Read moreDate of stay: June 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
