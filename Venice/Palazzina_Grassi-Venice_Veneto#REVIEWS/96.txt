Wonderful wonderful place with very friendly and attentive staff. The rooms are beautiful and the styling across the hotel is exceptionally cool. We took a junior suite for our anniversary weekend and we were just blown away by the whole experience from check in to check out. Everyone knew your name and you really had the feeling of being members of a very exclusive club. I recommend the aperitivo on board at sunset, it may seem a bit pricey but if it's for a special occasion you won't have a much more romantic experience than being whisked around the canals whilst you enjoy wonderful canap√©s and prosecco!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
