2 minutes from the San Samuele Water bus stop on the Grand Canal. We stayed in the Club G building on the water. Room was good size, mini balcony courtyard, small sitting space Building has separate entrance, nice sitting room downstairs. Small balcony that sits right on the Canal off the club. Grab a bar stool and take it outside and enjoy the view. Bar in the main building has a wonderful sitting area, very active but quiet. Staff  is friendly and attentive. We also booked an hour water taxi tour with wine and appetizers with the concierge. Pricey and worth it if you want to see part of Venice only the water can show you. SPG does it again.
