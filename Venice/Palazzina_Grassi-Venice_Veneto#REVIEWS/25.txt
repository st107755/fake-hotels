We stayed in Palazzina G for 1 night last weekend. We only booked 1 night due to availability but we were both glad that we didn't stay longer. The hotel is very pricey and really not worth it. Despite the decor and social areas being lovely, and the initial greeting being very welcoming the hotel really does not live upto expectation for the price. The rooms are not comfortable, very small, hard bed, neither of us slept particularly well. We were also awoken by some drilling at 8am! The toiletries and amenities in the room however are excellent, you could travel without anything and be ok. However there is little light, its all ambient so doing make-up is challenging in the evening  The food was nice (breakfast) but very pricey, 7 euros for a coffee and 8 euros for an orangeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
