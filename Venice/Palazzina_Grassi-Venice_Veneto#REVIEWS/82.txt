We had a lovely week at this hotel. Very personal service in a quiet atmosphere. There is no sign on the door and it's best if you book a taxi from your entry point through the hotel so they are waiting for you at their private dock upon your arrival. A welcome drink and a smooth, efficient check in! I recommend booking a suite as we did because the rooms are small. This hotel is also just steps away from the San Samuele vaporetto stop and it it very quiet since you are away from San Marco and Rialto. My one complaint is that there are no drawers and the closets are minuscule! But we would definitely stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
