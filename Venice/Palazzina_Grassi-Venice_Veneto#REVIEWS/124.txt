We stayed in the G House which is an apartment near the hotel run and maintained by the hotel. What a perfect choice for our family. Spacious, clean, well located. The breakfast is quite simple but more then enough. Very memorable stay. It is important to  remember to get off the San Samuele stop which is a short walk away when you are getting to the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
