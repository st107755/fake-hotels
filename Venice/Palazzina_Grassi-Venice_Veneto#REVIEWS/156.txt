Second time at this Philippe Starck hotel. But this is a cosy beautiful boutique hotel. Plenty of glass and hard services softened with an assortment of furniture classics. Breakfast is served until 2pm. How great is that?  Slightly off pitch but that's OK. Proper linen sheets - love them or hate them. This is Italy straight out of a 50s movie. Outstanding service without any attitude. Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
