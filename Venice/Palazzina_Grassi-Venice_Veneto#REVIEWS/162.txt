Stayed at this hotel for a night after a cruise and would not stay there again, was definitely not value for money as the room charges were very high (even for Venice) but the room was extremely small.  No reception but checking in is done in the restaurant - first impressions were bad and also it was hard to find.  We have stayed in Venice a few times but this was the most expensive but the worst experience.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from Linda M, General Manager at Palazzina GrassiResponded Nov 3, 2014Dear guests,  I extremely regret to read your negative feedback and I would like to clarify some aspects that might have led you to a misinterpretation of our hotel and services.   Your reservation was for a Superior room, our standard category of about 22 sq. mt. I can assure you that the size of it is well within the Venetian standards (and not only Venetian) for standard rooms.   The discounted rate you booked (in February this year) is among our lowest rates for the room category chosen.   PalazzinaG does have a reception but, although what is common in the most of the hotels, checking-in here is done in our PG’s Restaurant & Bar where all our guests are offered a welcome drink while our Reception staff can take care of all the procedures before taking you to your room.  The PG’s Restaurant & Bar is like more a cozy living room than a restaurant.   Furthermore, the charges for our services are those of a five-star-hotel, definitely not more.   Our hotel is located on the Grand Canal, in the area between Rialto and Accademia bridge, therefore quite easy to find and with a public transport stop just around the corner.   I do hope you’ll have the chance to come back to Venice one day and I would be pleased, if you decided to renew your preference to our hotel: all our staff will more than pleased to have you experienced the real Venetian life in Italy’s first Philippe Starck’s designed hotel.  Best Regards Linda MariottiRead more
