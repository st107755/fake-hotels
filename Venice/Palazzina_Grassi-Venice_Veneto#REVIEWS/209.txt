This hotel is perfect.  Can't complain about a thing.  The whole hotel is beautifully design and the lobby is trendy and a great place to relax and have a drink.  Rooms are again well designed, beautiful, everything you need.  Service is excellent (we got a free upgrade while there, spent some time chatting with the lobby bartenders - all was great!).  Its a little bit of a walk to the main sights, but not bad.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare
