A very stylish hotel with some fabulously quirky features - all very Phillipe Stark - but in parts was a bit scruffy. We had a junior suite on the second floor with its own private terrace. The room was a good size but in need of renovation as it had the feeling that it had been 'well used'. There were mirrors everywhere that take some getting used to and overall it felt a bit soulless, unlike the public areas. The dining room/bar was beautifully furnished with a mix of contemporary, vintage styled and traditional furniture, Merano glass lights and fittings, along with an abundance of Venetian mirrors. The staff were excellent and very attentive (they noted from my passport that it was my birthday and presented a cake) but the room we had was disappointing.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from Palazzina G, Direttore generale at Palazzina GrassiResponded Mar 21, 2018Dear StreamsUK,  Thank you for choosing Palazzina for your stay in Venice and for your review.  We are glad that you enjoyed the design of Palazzina by Philippe Starck and the uniqueness of our dining room/bar. We are also proud about the service offered by our Staff and we really appreciate your positive comments about it.  Regarding the rooms, all of them have very fragile and delicate furniture and materials such as light coloured carpets, big mirrors (which are one of the main elements of the design), metal tables and white leather sofas which with the everyday use are easy to be ruined even if we keep a high level of cleaning standards and maintenance.  Just for your information, we are planning soon some renovations and we have already started with some suites.  Thank you once again for your feedback and we hope to welcome you again in the future, Kind regards,   The Management  Read more
