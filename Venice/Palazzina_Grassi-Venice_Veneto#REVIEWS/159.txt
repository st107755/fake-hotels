My husband and I went on our Minimoon here. Beautiful modern hotel with fabulous detailing. From beautiful mirrored bedrooms, to mascarade print details in the bath room. The service is great the air conditioning was a nightmare but the team were able to change our room with pace. It's one of the most modern hotels I've stayed in Italy and will definitely be going back . Thank you for such great hospitalityRead moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
