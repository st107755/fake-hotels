Spent 4 nights at this great hotel with my husband. The day before we arrived, we were warned by email there would be a private party at the hotel on our first night. T o cut the story short, there was a posh party till about 4am with DJs, loads of people etc.The music was incredibly loud till then. We were kind of ok with it as we were there for hour nights and we just accepted we wouldnt sleep on our first night. If we were there just for the weekend, i would be very angry and would never ever return. The place needs to decide if they want to be a hotel or a club. Both is not possible. Otherwise the hotel was good, nice breakfast, great location, and good service. They ll give you good local tips on food etc so ask them!Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
