We booked a three-night stay at Palazzina Grassi for my wife’s thirtieth birthday, and we are so lucky, blessed and thankful to have been able to live such an experience. The hotel is very clean, the rooms and hotel is well designed: very comfortable and luxurious in a modern way; but most importantly, the team is extremely welcoming and friendly. From Silvia in reservations to Luca in front desk and Michele at the restaurant/bar, everybody made us feel like a privileged prince and my wife like a princess. It has been an amazing experience which I can only highly recommend. The room is very comfortable, especially for Venice. As a fifth visit to this amazing city, this is the best Palace. Thank you for making my wife’s XXX birthday incredible! 😊Read moreDate of stay: January 2020ValueCleanlinessServiceRoom Tip: Ideally if you have the budget ask for Canal viewsSee more room tips1 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
