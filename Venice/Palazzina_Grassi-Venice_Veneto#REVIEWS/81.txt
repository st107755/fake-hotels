We stayed at the Palazzinag for our honeymoon.We arrived by private water taxi to the hotel and the staff were waiting for us with a complimentary drink at the bar. The decor of the hotel is amazing and the hotel room blew us away, I did say I wouldn't want to be the mirror cleaner in that place. There are mirrors EVERYWHERE. They're were complimentary chocolate strawberries, processo and biscuits waiting for us in our room. We decided to have a meal at the resident restaurant called P&G. It's a lovely private restaurant and they only allow residents to dine and drink there, so we had the place to ourselves. The waiters couldn't do enough for us. If your feeling brave try the taster menu with wine, it's 300 euros so not cheap, but a great experience. The scallops were amazing. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
