Myself and my husband stayed here for three nights for our Wedding Day in Venice and I cannot begin to advise on how amazing this hotel was. We stayed in a Junior Suite with Terrace which was out of this world, so modern, chic and clean we were literally blown away upon arrival - the view from the room was fantastic too. The hotel kindly steamed my wedding dress upon arrival and hung in my room - they welcomed us with free drinks in the beautiful lounge and we felt so special!  It was the level of detail and service that was something we had never experienced before, this is a proper 5 star luxury hotel without the stiff atmosphere and ridiculous prices. Breakfast is ordered the night before and you can choose to have it delivered to the room (I did this on the wedding morning) or down in the lounge which was perfect too.   On our wedding day, the hotel sent us a lovely note,  chocolates and a bottle of wine which was a fantastic touch. They were always aware of your needs and when you were in the room so you would never be disturbed. The comfort of the bed was like sleeping on a cloud - pure luxury.  I would without a doubt return to Palazzina Grassi, infact I have already looked at next year for our anniversary - it was a very special occasion for us and we couldn't have asked for a better hotel to stay with. Thank you for everything!!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2020RoomsCleanlinessService1 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
