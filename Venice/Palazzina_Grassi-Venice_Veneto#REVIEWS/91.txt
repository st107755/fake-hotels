My husband and I spent 3 nights here as part of our honeymoon and the attention to detail of the rooms and our vacation was truly amazing. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful with anything we needed. Rooms were stunning and beautiful. And being off the beaten track was a plus as the hotel was always private with little noise. Definitely a place we will stay again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
