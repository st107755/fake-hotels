Do you expect your room to be made up by 3:00pm after returning from sightseeing?  You could be dissappointed at Palazzina G where they explained their policy allows for as late as 4pm.  The snafus go on from there.  Curiously, it is in the customer's best interest because this reduces their pricing power....which translates into competitive rates.  Also, possibly importantly...the hotel has dead vibe.  Their F&B struggles, which is too bad.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
