We had a lovely weekend staying at Palazzina G. The reception staff were very welcoming. It is ideally located for exploring Venice on foot or on the water. The room was comfortable, contemporary and had everything we needed. One very small thing that could easily be improved was the sheets, linen was a bit of an odd choice for comfort. The only thing that was a bit disappointing was the bar/ restaurant. We were there for on evening when the water was very high, so it was tricky to get about. The staff were not friendly and the service was very slow ..not very welcoming. This is a shame as the reception staff are very good.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare
