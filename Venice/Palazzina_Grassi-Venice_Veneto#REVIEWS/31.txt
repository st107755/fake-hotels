We arrived at our hotel by private water taxi, we were greeted at reception, our bags were taken and were advised by the receptionist that we could book in at the bar with a complimentary drink.  Myself and my friend had champagne and strawberries and my husband and friend had craft Venetian beers lovely start. We were then shown to our room which was just like all the photos amazing, also in our room was savoury snack, macaroons and a complimentary bottle of prosecco on ice wonderful.  The staff we found very friendly and helpful at all times.  My only and I mean only bug bear is no iron in room or hotel so make sure you take one aspressing service quite expensive.  I will definitely recommend this hotel to all.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
