We stayed here for 2 nights. Beautiful hotel in a superb location. Staff were very polite and happy! Our room was spacious and comfortable, the bathroom was also of a good size. My only criticism would be when we ate in the hotel restaurant the chef was obviously trying out putting different flavours together, I wasn't really a fan and found it a bit odd. Breakfast however was lovely. All in all, I would recommend this very beautiful hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
