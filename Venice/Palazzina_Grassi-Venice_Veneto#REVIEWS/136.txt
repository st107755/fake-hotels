I had the grand canal one bedroom and it was superb.  Hotel is beautiful, in a great location; short walk to everything, nearby St. Stephan square with its non-touristy boutiques and restaurants and right on the vaparetto stop but away from the overwhelming crowds.  Service is very responsive and the free mini bar is well stocked and a nice surprise.  I think the breakfast that is included could be better, but that's a minor tweak.
