Absolutely loved this place with bells on - excellent location, subzero decor and fabulous dedicated staff. This is a place to come back to. Our room was beautiful and well designed - the main dining room bar has a very interesting and eclectic decor - very Italian. The staff here were all so friendly and helpful making fantastic recommendations and bookings at restaurants, helping us print a few documents etc. Honestly this is one of the best hotels I have every stayed at. Loved it. Thank you Palazzina G.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
