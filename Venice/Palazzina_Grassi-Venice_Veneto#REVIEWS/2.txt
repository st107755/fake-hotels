We went for a weekend to Venice with the family of 4 & accidentally found Palazzina G which was a great surprise. We loved the staff, location, the rooms & the state of the art breakfast! Also visit the Palazzo Grazzi next door whoâ€™s having great photo exhibitions. Go and find this hidden secret!Read moreDate of stay: August 2020Trip type: Traveled with family1 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
