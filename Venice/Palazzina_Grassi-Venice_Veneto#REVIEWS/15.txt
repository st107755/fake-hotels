This is a truly great place to stay. It is warm and welcoming and the staff are highly courteous and very willing to be helpful.  Our room was very comfortable. It does have a 'wacky' feel about it - in the nicest possible way. The decor is not conventional but that only added to the experience. Breakfast is perfectly served and generous. Evening meals are available and the hotel offers a quality menu.  The hotel is in a perfect spot in the city. You are only a relatively short walk from the major tourist sites (Rialto Bridge, St Mark's Square) and many galleries and museums (Palazzo Grassi is next door!). However, the hotel is also in a relatively quiet and uncrowded area.  Definitely recommended.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare
