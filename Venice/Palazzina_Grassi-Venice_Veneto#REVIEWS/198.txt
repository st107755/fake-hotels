You can go to Venice and sleep in the old fashioned hotels or you can go to Palazzina G. Very modern rooms with eye for details in every inch!  If you go to website, what you see is what you get (what a difference with other hotel pictures you see on the internet...) Staff extremely friendly, breakfast on bed a must, overall location => great. We visited many other hotels like Bauer, Cipriani, Danielli... .  We were very happy to have chosen Palazzina G!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
