Finding a good luxury property in Venice that is not your traditional venetian style is few and far between but this place is exactly that. No offense to anyone who likes it, it's just not my style and this probably isn't the right hotel if you do.  Very small boutique hotel, you'll work with a handful of employees for everything so the service is very personal.  I loved the style of the hotel, especially the room. It does have an Italian feel but it's updated with a luxury cool style and not ultra modern contemporary.   Restaurant was amazing, Bar is great, location is great thank you very much staff for such a great stay I'll be back with my wife for sure and will send many recommendations to anyone going to Venice.  Tip, goto the Krug room it's a hidden lounge very cool.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
