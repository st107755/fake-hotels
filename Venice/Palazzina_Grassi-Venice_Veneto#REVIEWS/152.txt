This is a beautifully designed hotel in a central but quiet location. We stayed in a junior suite which was very light and a good size. The ambiance was helped by the fab mirrors on each wall! The main event at the hotel is the wonderful bar and restaurant. Fabulous furniture and music made it a very seductive place to hang out. We returned from the bustle of Central Venice each evening and treated ourselves to a nightcap and dessert.  This is a very good hotel indeed, especially if like us, you are looking for something different from the usual floral/dark wood room often found in the city.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare
