Wonderful experience here! My husband and I stayed for a few days at this lovely place. We stayed in the grand canal suite which was absolutely fabulous. Great staff and very enjoyable experience here. Definitely recommend taking one of the many private boat rides they have to offer as well :) Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
