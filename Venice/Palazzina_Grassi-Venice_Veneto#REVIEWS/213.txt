If you are planning a trip to Venice anytime soon and I suggest you do. Then go out of season and a stay here and you won't be disappointed.   While not overlooking the grand canal (most rooms anyway) it is super close and within a very realistic walking distance of everything, there is even a water taxi station almost directly outside.  The rooms are small, but this is Venice not Vegas but impeccably furnished with Philippe Starck touches throughout all rooms. The restaurant is casual and has an exception feature of serving you breakfast when YOU want not when it suits them! We didn't visit the VIP room but suggest if you get a chance you do.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare
