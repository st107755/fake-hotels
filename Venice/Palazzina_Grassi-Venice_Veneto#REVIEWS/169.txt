I booked a short break, in what looked to be a quirky, romantic hotel. Well, this place was everything you could imagine, and then some. The room decoration was amazing, we had a superior room that was large, clean, comfortable, with a number of extra's. The bed was also huge. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, the breakfast was wonderful, we were very impressed. Location is also good, a short walk to all of the tourist attractions, and some good local restaurants.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
