We fell in love with this place. We arrived by water limo, to have our bags collected & escorted a short distance to the hotel. As soon as we walked through the door, this place is cool.. I can see why they have a JD suite. If you decide to visit come during Carnival & discover why we all get addicted to Venice.. Unbelievably enchanting & rather than ruin the surprise it's best you discover this magical place for yourself. Who ever built Venice, thank you, thank you, thank you. Everyone feels beautiful here.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
