We loved the luxury that is in every corner of this hotel. Do yourself a favor and favor and favor and take the â‚¬90 personal water taxi straight to the back entrance of the hotel. They will meet you and bring your luggage to the hotel. We had a beautiful white mirrored suite with a gorgeous balcony overlooking the hilltops of Venice. The hotel is located in a great area where you can walk to the Rialto market, Jewish ghetto, academic bridge, and most importantly St. Mark's Square. It is also located by a few very delicious restaurants. Great service by all the staff. We enjoyed our time here immensely. Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare
