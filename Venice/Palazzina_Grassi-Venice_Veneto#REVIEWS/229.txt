great room, excellent staff.  Very good restaurant.  I have stayed at the Gritti, and the Danieli, and I liked this hotel the most!   This is a small, fresh, and quiet luxury hotel. You feel at home here with everyone attending to your needs.  I would go back to The Pallazina Grassi in a heartbeat!Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
