I went for a short 2 nights break with my wife at Palazzina G in Venice in it was a wonderful experience from the moment we arrived and got welcomed by Luca to the moment we've left. Welcome drink, great dinner at the Krug on the first evening, great breakfasts and of course the wonderful Philippe Starck design. I we have to go back to Venice we would definitively go back to Palazzina G and I recommend that place to anybody who loves modern and original design.Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare
