My new husband I and I stayed dor 3 nights after our wedding. It was our first trip to venice and we were not disappointed. We chose to treat ourselves to a private water taxi from the airport which took us right outside the hotel which is located down a small alley next to Pallazina grassi. Check in was lovely and we were invited fir a complimentary drink in the bar whilst our bags were taken to our room. The room was spotless, on the small side but based on previous reviews I knew this was the case. We also had been given a complimentary bottle of prosecco following our wedding which was a nice touch. Beds were comfy and it was in a quiet part of town so no noise or problems sleeping. Great location near the vaporetta stop and key areas such as academia and st marks square. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
