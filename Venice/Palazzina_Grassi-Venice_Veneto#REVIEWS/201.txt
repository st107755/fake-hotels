We are going to Venice at least once per year. we decide to try Palazina G has we have been tented by an offer on one of those new website they we where suppose to get 70% off the normal price in fact it was more then 20% off. What ever, we where please to go anyway and discover a new place. The Palazina G is a typical Boutique hotel so expect no reception. The main room which is in fact the restaurant is very "Stackish",  it is very dark which can work in winter but is a bit oppressive in summer. The room are ok: white, full of mirror to make it bigger, very cosy. However, the roof lounge lack of attention and staff.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
