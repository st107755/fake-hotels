We are pleased to know you liked the room and we are sorry to read about the inconvenience occurred with the transfer. We would like to clarify that our transfer service can be arranged in advance with our Front Office staff who always sends a confirmation via email with the details of the pick up and meeting point. This service is never prepaid and it is billed to the room account to be settled upon check out.  Unfortunately there was no transfer service booked and confirmed with the hotel on your behalf.
