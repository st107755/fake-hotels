Breakfast is an absolute winner, beautiful and served at any time of the day and in any location in the hotel. Superb. I just wish more small hotels would follow suit. The hotel is located up an alley about 50 meters from the canal. Nicely tucked away from the crowds. The picture on their web site had us believing the hotel was situated on the canal itself – it’s not! Nice roof garden to sit and sunbathe and have breakfast on. Excellent food, service on the whole good but some of the staff can appear moody. Our exec room was smaller than we expected and as with the rest of the hotel brimming with mirrors. It’s a good experience staying here especially if you like exotic glass decorations. Maybe a little more thought could go into the practicalities of actually staying in a room…Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
