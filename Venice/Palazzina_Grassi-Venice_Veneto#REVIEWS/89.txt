Amazing hotel. Didnt expect to find a hotel in that alley.   If you enjoy art and looking for contemporary design in a lovely city, then Palazzina G is a must. As soon as we checked in we had a welcome drink and tried the spiritz (not sure how to spell it). The hotel is unique and appreciates mirrors. Our room was full of mirrors, clean and was lovely. For those who are enjoying their honeymoon, the mirrors add an "exotic" aspect to ur stay.   Michael or Mikele (bartender) is very friendly. Cuz of Mikele I will be preparing spiritz cocktail at home :D.  We were lucky enough to witness and enjoy the international film festival after party at our hotel.  I will be back to this lovely hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
