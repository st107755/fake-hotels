My wife and I spent just one night here in Aug 15, and were very impressed. The staff were very professional and friendly, and nothing was too much trouble.   Our suite was very comfortable and well furnished, and there was a great selection in the mini bar! We ate at the restaurant for our evening meal, and my only criticism would be the price/quality of the food. The food is good, but I was not blown away, and for me it was rather expensive for what we received in terms of quality.    The hotel is located about a 10-12 min walk from San Marco square, but its far enough away to escape the hustle and bustle!    We will certainly stay here again when next visiting Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
