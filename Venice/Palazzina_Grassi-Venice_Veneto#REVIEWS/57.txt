3 days of perfect stay - hotel is fabulous   Wonderful design - as expected for Starck - great location / friendly, informative and very helpful staff and really nice food - both breakfast and room service (which was a surprise, as most room service isn't as good as the restaurant - this is)  Beautiful room and a good size- with stunning design   Next door to the Palazo Grassi - with a truly incredible Damien Hirst / Ancient ship wreck / treasure exhibition - wow  A must stay!!! 9/10Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
