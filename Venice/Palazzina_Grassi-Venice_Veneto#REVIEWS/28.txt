This is one of the worst hotels we stayed at on our trip to Italy. First of all the elevator stopped working there was a horrible smell from the floods that came up to the third floor he WiFi wasn’t working because they were fixing some cables - worst of all no one apologized or tried to make up for this disgusting stay!!!! I was so grossed out!!!! And for such an expensive hotel - just shocking! I finally tried to tell the manager during check out and he was “busy - I will never stay here again which is a shame because I come to Italy a lotRead moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
