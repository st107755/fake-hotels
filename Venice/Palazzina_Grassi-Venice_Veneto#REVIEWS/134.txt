Just an easy stroll away from the hustle and bustle of central Venice. A quiet haven from the heat and tourists. Great breakfasts particularly up on the terrace - or for afternoon drinks. The rooms may be a bit trendy but are very nice, particularly if you like mirrors. The young staff were very helpful. We had a lovely stay and could recommend this hotel in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
