The Palazzina Grassi was quite a disappointment to us.  We were looking forward to staying in a new, hip hotel in Venice.   We stayed for three nights.   While the design is attractive, we had multiple problems with the hotel.   We had to change rooms twice, because the lights were not functioning properly.    We also found the staff to have surprisingly limited knowledge of the city, in terms of restaurants and tourist attractions.   For example, they could not even tell us where a nearby ATM would be located.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
