My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night. We were upgraded to a suite which offers wonderful amenities. It was an amazing overall experience. It is centrally located on the Grand Canal. 15 minute walk to the Piazza San Marco. It is easily accessible from the Cruise Port through the public water bus (stop S. Samuel in 20 minutes for 7.50 euros each). We took a private water taxi to the train station the next morning (10 minutes for 60 euros).
