There's no getting away from the fact that the hotel has been wonderfully designed, however this great design cannot excuse the lack and quality of service which is contrary to what one would expect from a place such as this At check in the gentleman was very helpful and polite but he was pretty much the only one. From barmen leaving dirty, empty glasses in front of us for well over an hour while we rested from our walk around Venice, to the housekeeping staff descending the stairs as I was heading up causing me to wait for them to pass while hugging the wall (and I might add without even a sniff of a "good morning" salutation), from the surly breakfast waitress to even more surly morning receptionist I am left completely underwhelmed by this hotel experience. What a pity.
