absolutely amazing location right outside of San Marco.  only a 5 minute walk from most major attractions and the water, above busy, high end street.  the staff could have been nicer, but it wasnt a major issue.  also, be aware of the fact that you can only turn on thr power in the room by sticking the room card key in a socket near the door, and because the building is so old, the room seems a bit crooked.  AND the complimetary breakfast is located on the first floor- noone tells you that!Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
