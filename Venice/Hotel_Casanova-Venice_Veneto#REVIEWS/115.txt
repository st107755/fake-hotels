This hotel has a great location, an easy walk from vaporetto stop San Marco Vallaresso (Line 1 or 2) and very close to Piazzo San Marcos.  We loved our large room with 2 comfortable stuffed armchairs and windows with shutters overlooking 2 streets.  I appreciated all the hooks and shelves in the large bathroom. The views from the breakfast room on the 2nd floor were also nice and so were the free breakfasts. I was glad they had an elevator, and the room was a very good price.  	Only downside was the noisy late-night party sounds Saturday night out our windows.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
