great location, lovely staff, only complaint is shower was rainfall and have to reach through it to change temperature, meaning you can get scalded, and just not great.  Funky decor, just like a casanova, velvet wallpaper dark red and yellow.  Room was HUGE.  included a  fridge.  I got cut rate through TA so it was also a great deal.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
