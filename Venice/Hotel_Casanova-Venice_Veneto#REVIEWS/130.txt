The staff at the hotel are very friendly, the rooms are cleaned daily, but it is not a 4* hotel. It's 3 stars and even thats a stretch. The room was basic, the bed slightly uncomfortable but okay. Breakfast was very nice, a decent variety and good juices!  The location is about 3 minute walk from st. marks square, we ate breakfast facing the Louis Vuitton store, thats how central it is. From the breakfast area you can see the Grand Canal. You are paying for the incredible location.  Perfect for a short stay for the price range.  If you expect luxury and location, this is not the place. Good for 3 nights because of its location, its also opposite 3 great restaurants for a good price.   Warning- there are mosquitos in some of the rooms. Our room had 3, we bought an anti-mosquitoâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
