Had a good deal - booked more or less last minute. I chose the Hotel because of its location - which is phantastic. Easy to find, 2 minutes to the vaporetto stop, right behind Piazza San Marco. Check in was very friendly and quick. Could leave my luggage there - also after check-out. Very nice and clean room on the 4th floor, well equipped. Very good breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: February 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
