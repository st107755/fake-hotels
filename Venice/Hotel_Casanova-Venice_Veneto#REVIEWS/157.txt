Very disapointing !!! Very dated hotel that could do with paintwork in the rooms. Bed and pillows were hard as rock and very uncomfortable.cupboard doors needed repairing as were hanging  off and not shutting properly.Hairdryer very dated.The location was excellent but be prepared if you are at the front of the hotel it is very noisy.Never got any sleep for 3 days.Breakfast was reasonable.Would not recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare
