A nice hotel really close to marks square and the vaporetta. We are in room 444 next to the lift and we are kept awake all night by a noise and then a bang. Reception say it is the lift but it is constant all night. We can hear the lift but this is a different noise. I would stay here again but not in room 444.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from hotelcasanovait, ricevimento at Hotel CasanovaResponded May 2, 2019 Dear Customer, Thank you for reporting the problem, we have already arranged for the accommodationRead more
