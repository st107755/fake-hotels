Stayed for a long weekend. Satisfactory hotel. Lift to the four floors. Breakfast on the first floor.   Not much of a lounge as a meeting point. Hotel is more of a place to sleep than to socialise. No dining other than breakfast. Shabby chic Italian decor. Good size room and en suite. Dark but thankfully very very cool with (noisy) air con that is on constantly and provides welcome relief from the heat outside. Large bed so plenty of room for two.  Very close to San Marco.  Iâ€™d probably return.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare
