The hotel located in the heart of Venice at the St Marks or Marco stop i.e the very last stop. Its a 2 star budget hotel with no coffee making facilities. Just imagine a night without hot water to drink except you go out to the nearby bar or restaurant, luckily we were only for one night stay. Wifi is only available at the lobby - a very small one with few seating. Breakfast was sufficient to fill an empty stomach.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare
