Charming hotel a block from Piazza San Marco. We are thankful that we booked a superior room, as room sizes in Venice are typically quite small. The room was also very dark, re: likely tied to decor, re: red walls. Room was very clean. Good free breakfast, but missing some of the more healthy food choices. Staff were very friendly and helpful, throughout the hotel. Good Wi-fi throughout the stay. The misses - lack of toiletries in room, no kettle/coffee in room, no ability to control room temperature (all requests for temp change were via front desk). Shower stall - extremely slippery/dangerous, with no mats, etc,Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
