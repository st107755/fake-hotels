Casanova is a very nice hotel. It is situated just near San Marco square, it is cosy, clean and comfortable ( nice bed, no noise, spacious bathroom). At the front desk they are welcoming and helping. At this time of the year it has been a good value for money having also breakfast included. I recommend it for a comfortable visit in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
