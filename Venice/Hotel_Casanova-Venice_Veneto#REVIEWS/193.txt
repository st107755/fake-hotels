I don't understand people who want to pay for economy seat, but expect a business class 180 degree reclining one for the same price. This Hotel happens to be a decent property that is priced moderately and is in a location that is  simply amazing.  The place is 100 mts from the Vaporetto station, 50 mts from St Marks Square, Hard Rock Cafe is just a found the corner and is surrounded by all kind of shops and cafes. What else would a tourist want?   The staff is really friendly as well as helpful, rooms happen to be fully functional, entire property exudes an old world charm and the breakfast more than adequate.   Yes, they need an upgrade. But the moment they do upgrafe, please remember that then they will start charging like JW Marriot, and You and I will not be able to stayâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
