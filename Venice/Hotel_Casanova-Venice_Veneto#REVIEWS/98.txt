Stayed here for 3 nights .the hotel is in a fabulous location .  Defiantly will be returning . Breakfast wasn't that apealing, not much on offer .  We had the evening gondola but at €80 for 30min I did not think this was worth it .  We did take the boat trip and for the cost thus was well worth it ..lovely day out .  To finish the holiday we had a water taxi  for  €60 to the train station ..really was worth every penny.    Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
