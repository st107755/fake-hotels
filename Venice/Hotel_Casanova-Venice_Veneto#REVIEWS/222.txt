nice beautiful villa .. excellent host .. free bicycles .. great breakfast .. decent prices for an expensive place .. Alessandro made us feel at home .. had triple room with an extra bed for our children ... the garden is a perfect place to chill out ... clean, friendly typical pensione which we would defintely recommend to anybody who wish to stay away over priced venice hotels and enjoy beautiful Lido ... travelling to Venice is quite easy .. take vaporetto nr 1 ... get out in Giardini for the most beuatiful cafe " Paradiso ' over the world .. then walk down to Marco Polo or finish the scenic route until mid-Venice and get lost in narrow streetsRead moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
