I am basing my review on the fact that we got a bit of a bargain with the room rate for our stay.  Like others have said, the location is spectacular for the main sights and extremely convenient for the vaporetto. The room we had was basic but spotlessly clean - I think the sheets were changed every other day and were crisp and white. The bathroom was spacious but also in need of a refurb - the doors on the shower were off their runners permanently! Again clean with lovely new white towels. Breakfast was good with plenty of variety and served til 10.30 am in a nice room overlooking the alley.  Reception staff were polite and helpful but the lobby did have a foisty smell at times which seemed worse after a downpour.  However this didn't extend to our bedroom or the breakfastâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
