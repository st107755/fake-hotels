We arrive to Venice and we made the biggest mistaken to booked this hotel online. The HOTEL DIRTY , NO SERVICE , NO VALUE FOR MONEY. Lots surrounding hotels with same money better values. Lots people said "GOOD LOCATION" , BUT ACTUALLY LOTS BETTER HOTEL WITH SAME MONEY AROUND THE AREA. All areas are walking distance. So it does not matter where you are all good. The hotel Wifi is bad , the pillows are hard as rock , the bed feel like only springs left , the blanket seem never been wash. THE ONLY NEED FOR THIS HOTEL IS DEMOLITION AND BUILT NEW HOTEL. The owner MUST spend money to up grade the hotel. NOT JUST COLLECT MONEY WITH NOTHING BACK TO GIVE TO VISITORS.  This hotel is the WORST HOTEL we ever stayed during our holiday travels life.  ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ these the hotel needs.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
