Arrived at the hotel and got a room in the fifth floor. The elevator took us to the fourth floor only and then we had to climb a full flight of stairs. Nobody helped us. The room was okay, had trouble with the safe, but acceptable. But the heat was intense! Turned on the air conditioning and after two hours, nothing! We had it at 10 degrees. When we called the reception, we were told the technician was not going to be in until the following day (it was five o'clock in the afternoon). I asked to change rooms, but nothing was available.  Poor service!!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
