The hotel is centrally located, it was a 2 minute walk from the water taxi stand for me. It is located right next to Piazza San Marco square.  The rooms are comfortable with comfortable toilets.  The hotel promises free wifi but it does not work in the rooms. It is only limited to the reception area and in enquiring why it's not coming in the room the standard reply is it comes in some and doesn't come on some rooms but the reality is its not available beyond the reception area as the wifi router is installed right there.  No electric kettles in the room, so no facility of tea coffee in the  room  The breakfast layout is OK  We were leaving early at 6 am and requested if breakfast can be packed for us as it happens in all hotels in Europe, the reception staff simply refused. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
