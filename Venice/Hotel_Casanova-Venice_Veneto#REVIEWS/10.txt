Hotel is fab and location even better.  Price for three night stay in December just a little over Â£200. A bargain for a four star hotel in Venice.  The breakfast was included in the price, not great, but ok.  If the receptionist was more friendly and helpful I would of awarded the hotel a four star, however our last memory of the visit was of the unfriendly Receptionist.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare
