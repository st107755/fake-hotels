We stayed two nights in this hotel.  Staff, especially Stefano, was very friendly and pleasant.  Our double room was spacious for Venice standards with a large bathroom.  The breakfast was OK and typical of European hotels.  The location was the best part of this hotel, right next to Piazza San Marco and convenient to other main site seeing locations.  The hotel provides a free water taxi ride to Murano, although, you have to sit through a rather long marketing presentation by the factory they take you to. The only thing I did not like about the hotel was the noise from the street under our window. And that was our choice since Stefano offered other rooms that were not facing the street.  However, they were smaller and not as nice as this one.  Overall, I recommend this hotel. Read moreDate of stay: October 2005HelpfulShare
