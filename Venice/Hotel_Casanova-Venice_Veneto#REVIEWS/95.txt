The hotel is in a great location, easy to get to from the water taxis and easy to get everywhere from. The room was big & clean, which was nice.  Downfalls were breakfast - completely a let down.  The last time I was in Venice I stayed at Hotel Concordia, just a few minutes walk from here also in San Marco and they had an incredible breakfast. The only thing that was good on this buffet was the Orange Juice.  When we were leaving we had to pay the city tax and they didn't have enough change for us so we had to over pay the tax and the man at reception was a bit rude about it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
