Close to vaporettos, San Marco Square, shopping, restaurants Giudecca Canal, Grand Canal.  Great Wifi and good breakfast to start your day.  Walk to everything you need to see in Venice, or to catch a boat should you want to travel to the beaches. We found the hotel service to be very good.  Reasonably priced, we will stay here again on our next trip. There is an elevator and air conditioning. Netflix on the TV to fall asleep to.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare
