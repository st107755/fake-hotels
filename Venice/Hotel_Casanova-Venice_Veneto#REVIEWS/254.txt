The location is excellent, the price is fair, the rooms are comfortable, and the breakfast was sufficient and tasty. Yes, this should qualify a higher star rating yet there was something missing...a feeling that our business was appreciated. We do not expect over the top service for a 3 star hotel but a simple smile or hello would be nice! There were a few staff who were kind (thank you Carlos and Dario) but the attitude of some (may have been the owner?) were simply sour! Learn to smile and say good morning...it's customer service 101 !!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
