I had to cancel my trip to Italy because of the Carona Virus.  I had  booked and paid for evertything well in advance.  Most places so far have been very good with refunds, but, even with 9 weeks notice, Hotel Casanova has refused any refund.    When the virus passes and I recreate my Italian itinerary, I will be rebooking the hotels and tours that provided refunds this time.  Hotel Casanova will not be on the list.Read moreDate of stay: March 2020LocationService2 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
