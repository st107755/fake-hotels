The hotel is near to the pier San Marco BUT that about it .First , the staff was rude - request for hot water in the room  and was flatly  refused with a No and he quickly turn around - signal to you the conversation has ended .The room was spacious but equip with ill-fitting facilities . The cupboard door cannot be close , most of the bathroom light cannot be on.  pillow were flat  and although free wifi was provided , it was never in range to be connected . Worst of all , the window faced a narrow alley with many eateries , you will be plagued with noises throughout the night . Like I say ,good location but thats all if you are only asking for that !!Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare
