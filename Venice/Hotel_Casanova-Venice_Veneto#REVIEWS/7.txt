Great hotel. Upgraded to a suite for free. Location is great, only a two minute walk from St Mark's Square. Just a couple of downers: the room had no tea or coffee facilities (although the breakfast was included which we didn't try), and the air conditioning wasn't very good. My wife and I stayed for three nights. All in all would recommend.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
