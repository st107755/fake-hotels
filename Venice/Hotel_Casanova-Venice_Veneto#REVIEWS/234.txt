We thought that we would try and stay really close to St Marks. This place is really close to St. Marks but if your with kids I'd save your money and stay on the mainland. Venice in the St Marks end gets pretty quiet at night and to be honest once you've wandered the streets all day you wont really fancy doing it again at night. For a couple I'd imagine it would be romantic. The hotel is nice, but quite worn and small if your with a family. The kids slept on a couch and cot which was fine. The aircon was out of the 60's so not very effective and it was loud at night. The hotel did a nice breakfast which set you up for the day. Overall a nice place, but nothing to get excited about.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
