We loved our 5 days in Venice, exploring and absorbing so much history from many years ago. Our stay was made easier and more convenient by staying at Casanova Hotel which is less than 100 metres from San Marco Square. The dining room (includes simple breakfast) looks straight down a lane to the grand canal entrance (cruise ship spotted at breakfast one morning). We understood that Venice is very old as are the hotels so uneven floors and aged decor are character traits of a wonderful place which we enjoyed immensely. We slept well considering the jet lag and the narrow lanes and lack of soundproofing. All these things make the Venice experience a great time and our stay in Casanova Hotel was excellent value considering the location, character and price.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
