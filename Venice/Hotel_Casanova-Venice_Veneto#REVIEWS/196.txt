That is what this hotel is all about.  The location is perfect, within a couple of minutes of St Marks Square and the water taxi stop made this the perfect place for our stay in Venice.  The room was comfortable with a  fridge and safe and en suite. All what you would require for a weekend break.  We did have a room on the back of the hotel where you could just see the buildings of St Marks Square.  Nice little Cafe straight across from Hotel and lots of lovey places to eat all within 5 minutes.  Great Gondala point also within 2 minutes.   Staff friendly and accomodating our room was reasy when we arrived a little early and they kept our bags for us on our day of departure too.   Breakfast basic but okay with rolls croissants and french toast. yogurt, tea and coffee.  All inâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
