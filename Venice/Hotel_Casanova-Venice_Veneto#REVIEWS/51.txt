I have been trying to get the hotel to respond to my emails since the issues I had back at the end of October with the floods in Venice but to this date they are still ignoring my emails and won't respond to my issue of them ignoring me when I had my booking and wanted to check it was safe to travel.  Terrible customer service.  Can't comment on the hotel as we never got there as they wouldn't confirm if it was safe to travel to the city.Read moreDate of stay: October 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
