This hotel is very close to St Marks Sq. you can go to most tourist attractions from here so it is really convenient. Hotel itself appears to be small but there were quite a few guests. Rooms were clean. It seems basic maintenance was lacking as toilet seat was loose. Hot water was a hit and miss as it was sometimes just lukewarm. Staff spoke English but limited conversations.  Very upmarket shops around this area. Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare
