The best thing about this hotel is the Location. It it just a few footsteps from St. Mark square. The ferry point is not far either. The staff did go out of its way to provide us an early breakfast at 5 am so that we could take our train to Rome in time. The room was spacious and clean; however the bathrooms looked a bit worn out.  Ask for one of the rooms on the higer floor so avoid disturbances from the street.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare
