The location is perfect! Just behind St Marco square, very close to the boat stop with only one small bridge to cross. We had to big suitcases, and we managed fine. The price is great and all worked out well. Small older property, but clean and friendly. There is a breakfast room on the first floor. Four floors with a lift. Wifi at reception and adjacent sitting room.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
