This hotel was dirty.  In one corner of our room the build up of dirt and dust was disgusting.  The noise level from the street/ally behind us was unbearable until 2 am.  We did not sleep either of the 2 nights spent here.  The night desk person was ok but the day guy could not be bothered.  The breakfast was barely average ( I could eat the yogurt.)  I was furious at my travel agent for booking us here.  It made Venice a not pleasant experience after staying in nice hotels in Rome and Florence.  Do not stay here.  It is also dark and depressing.Read moreDate of stay: October 2007HelpfulShare
