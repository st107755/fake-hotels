This hotel is really in the heart of Venice, a stones throw from St Marks Square and the canal. Our room was very spacious, excellent shower pressure, good heating (we needed it as it was snowing!) and a comfy bed. It had 4 windows so very light and airy! I can imagine in the summer it would be quite noisy if you had a room on the outside. Thereâ€™s a hairdryer, soap and shower-gel/shampoo in the bathroom, a safe and plenty of coat hangers in the bedroom.   Breakfast was good and varied - breads, pastries, cheese, eggs, bacon, cereal, fruit, yoghurt and even soya milk!   Overall a lovely stay in Venice and excellent value!
