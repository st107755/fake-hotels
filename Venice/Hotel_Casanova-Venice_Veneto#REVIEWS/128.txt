I booked this gorgeous property online, thinking we were getting the Bauer at an incredible rate. Actually, I was booking a Casa Nova Suite which is in a separate building next to the Bauer but not on the water. We had full access to the Bauer restaurants and enjoyed breakfast on the patio overlooking the Grand Canal. The suite was huge with a marble bathroom.  The decor looked a bit like a bordello. Heave velvet, dark colours. The location was ideal and it really was pretty good value for money. Just wish the offer stated it was in a separate building off of the water. Bottom line is we'd stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
