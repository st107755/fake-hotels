A large beautiful room, helpful staff and an excellent location. Also just 153 euro, so good value too with the breakfast included. Would happily stay here again.  Location is probably the best bit though. Almost on the square and around 100m from San Marco water taxi.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
