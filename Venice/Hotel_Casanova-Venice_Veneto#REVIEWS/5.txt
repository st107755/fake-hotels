Stayed in hotel Casanova back in April in one of the junior suites. The room was lovely and very clean, very spacious, bed was very comfortable with additional pillows given if required. The staff were friendly and always greeted you, (however a lot of reviews state the staff werenâ€™t very pleasant or helpful but myself and my partner had no issues, one of the receptionists was actually very helpful when it came to our departure on the water taxi.)I found the breakfast nice and had everything I was looking for. The location of the hotel was perfect centre of everything. The restaurant right opposite Casanova is very nice too. I would stay here again if decided to go back to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare
