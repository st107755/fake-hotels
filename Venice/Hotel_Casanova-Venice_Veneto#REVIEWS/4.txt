We spent three nights here last week and had an excellent experience  from start to finish.  Great staff and breakfast and, best of all, a wonderful location - in a beautiful lane with lovely shops, so close to St Mark's Square and the Grand Canal, vaporetto etc.  Great restaurant immediately opposite the hotel made dinner easy after long days exploring. Would definitely return to this hotel if coming back to Venice.  Read moreDate of stay: January 2020Trip type: Traveled with familyHelpfulShare
