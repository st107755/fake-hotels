Hotel Casanova was a very good choice for vacations in Venice, it is very close to San Marco's Square and to most of the attractions that were in this place. The room was amazing and very romance like the old Venice days, you can feel very warm and welcome on the hotel. The whole Staff was very polite and the service was very good. The breakfast was good with a lot of choices for a good start of the day. Also, another thing that we mention was that the hotel was very close to the river ships that you have to use to come and go to the airport that I think to think it.Read moreDate of stay: December 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
