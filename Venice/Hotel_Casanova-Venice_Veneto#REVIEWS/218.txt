This hotel prides itself on its 1930 's decor!!! Really what this means is it hasn't been updated since then. To be fair it is right in the action for st. Marco square and a lot of interesting shops. The breakfast for a continental is very good and the service is also good. On the con side of things, Room smells on arrival 331 was our room. Floor is uneven, Bathroom small very mouldy shower roof and walls, We had arranged for a double and single but were given 3 very hard singles, Internet only available in the shabby peeling lounge room. On the whole it was a big disappointment and almost tainted how we felt about Venice. We would not recommend this establishment at all and will mention to the travel agent to think twice before booking anyone else here.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
