Super location if you are travelling by car. The hotel has a parking and it is only 3 km from s. Marco square and less than 1km from Osteria do Torro in Piazza san Baraba where we eat (again) amazing pasta! The rooms are spacious and very quiet and breakfast adequate. The reception staff is friendly and capable. With its sister hotel Ca Doge it has become our favourite "pit stop" in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
