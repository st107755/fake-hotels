First let me start by the location directly behind San Marco square and easy 5 minute walk from the Alilaguna water taxi stop from the airport at San Marco pier stop  (over one bridge and walk up the street). Close to all the attractions. The hotel rooms are quite old but large compared to Venice standards. It was very hot and the A/C only just managed to cope. The bed was fine with a safe and small fridge in the room but no tea or coffee making facilities.Towels and soap was provided in the room and the shower in the bath worked well with no issues with hot or cold water. Wifi only works in the lobby but there were able seats to sit there and communicate if required. Breakfast is included in the price of the room and is good. Fruit, Cereal, Scrambled eggs, Bacon, bread rollsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
