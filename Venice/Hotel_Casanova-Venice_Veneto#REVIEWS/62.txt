This hotel is all about location. A 2 minute walk from st.Marks square. The hotel room was clean and spacious, breakfast was excellent, a help yourself buffet with a little bit of everything to set you up for the day. Have no complaints about the staff, Iâ€™ve stayed in friendlier places but I would still say the staff were friendly and helpful. Would stay again .Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
