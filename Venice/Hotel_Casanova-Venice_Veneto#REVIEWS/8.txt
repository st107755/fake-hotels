We were delighted by the appearance of our room. It was more than big enough for my teenage daughter and I. The shower was great and the bathroom was spacious. Breakfast was plentiful with good variety. It flooded on the morning of our checkout which stressed us a bit as we had a train to catch. The woman on reception was empathetic and helpful and we made our train with 10 minutes to spare. All in all, a great stay and we would definitely stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare
