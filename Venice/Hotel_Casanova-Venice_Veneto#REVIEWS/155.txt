It is a 3 star rated hotel, but I would give it more of a 2 stars. I've payed 50 euros/night on this hotel, I think this is the right amount given the good location and included breakfast but the room was quite bad. I would not pay much more for such conditions.  The bathroom was awful, it wasn't cleaned properly for ages, it smelled like a public toilet, the ventilation was insufficient, it had traces of mold on the wall and ceiling and the fixed hair drier was a total mess ( I don't think it was ever cleaned, and I'll say it about 10 years old )  The location of the hotel is as good as it gets, it takes 20 seconds to get to Saint Mark's square.  The breakfast room was nice and clean, and the breakfast it self was excellent: big variety of food, beverages and sweets nothing badâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare
