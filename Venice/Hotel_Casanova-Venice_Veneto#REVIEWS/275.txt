Location was the best thing a few meters from St Mark Square. No value for money in terms of service. Breakfast was non-existant with yogurt, juice, toast, butter, jam & coffee/tea - no milk - she grunted & screamed in Italian when we asked for milk to go with tea/coffee. That is not wht you expect when you have paid 150Euro/night.Read moreDate of stay: November 2009HelpfulShare
