This hotel was the first stop on my family vaction around Italy. They first got my mothers room information wrong. When she showed the proof of purchase from delta vacations for three days they stated that was not there proplem even though she was charged for three days, they literallly made her check out of the room day two becuase there information stated she only paid for two days and that they had a big party checking in the next day with reservations. The staff is not friendly and they are rude. Not to mention hot water was always a problem on a daily basis. On a positive note they are centrally located.Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
