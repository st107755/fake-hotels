Hotel Casanova was in a fantastic location, right behind St Mark’s Square. We requested a canal view and they did their best to do so! Could see the canal from our balcony. Our room was very spacious and cleaned fantastically every day. Breakfast was presented very well and many options available.   Another great feature was that the Tv’s in the room had Netflix and YouTube available which meant you could watch what you wanted (especially better if you can’t understand Italian with the tv channels).    Will be back again soon. Great trip and a perfect hotel for the perfect holiday.Read moreDate of stay: January 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
