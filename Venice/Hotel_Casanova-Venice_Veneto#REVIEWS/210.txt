We stayed one night in this hotel. The location is absolutely brilliant - just off St. Mark's square. You can do all your sightseeing by foot which is great, and it is super easy to get to from the train station by ferry or water taxi. Also great location for shopping and restaurants etc.  Rooms are basic but clean and have everything that you need. Service at this hotel was excellent. Would highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
