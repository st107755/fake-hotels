Location is OK but in a reasonably expensive area.  The hotel is small, old but clean.  The room we stayed in was spacious but we were provided with the absolute bare minimum.  A big problem was the noise from outside, somehow at 1am we were still able to clearly hear people talking outside and this was every night -  I needed ear plugs to sleep. The girls at reception were hardly friendly. They don't know the first thing about what it means to be in the hospitality industry. It's like they take for granted that regardless of service, they will always have business.   If you want a decent room to stay in at a good location then this is the hotel for you, but don't expect this hotel chain to go above and beyond as you will just be another customer to them.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
