I'm writing this as this was a stay due to being locked out of our other hotel! No research was done it was a case of here or the corridor of our other hotel! However, the man on reception could not have been more helpful (I am afraid I cannot remember his name)! He had one room left, he found us a better deal than we did on line and even helped out with my wife's asthma, who's inhaler was locked in our other hotel room! Made it all as easy as he could! The room was pretty basic but clean with good air con! Bathroom was nice! The only thing I found was a bit of a rattling window, but this wasn't enough to stop a good nights sleep! Thank you hotel Casanova! Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
