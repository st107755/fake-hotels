We stayed here for an overnight stay with our tour group. Hotel rooms are very big by European standard and bathrooms are huge! The decor is definitely unique and our room had a king size bed. The hotel is centrally located within walking distance of St, Mark's square and also the Grand Canal. Breakfast was basic but good. The elevator was broken when we had to check out but luckily our room was on the second floor was not not too far to carry our suitcase down. Overall loved the atmosphere of this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
