Rooms are small but very clean and the staff are very nice. This is so close to San Marco Square you can't believe it. Plus, less than 5 minutes walk to a stop of the main fairy to and from the airport. When you go to Venice, you will likely need to drag your luggage to your hotel so this is important. I would certainly stay here again on business. Might look for something with more amenities for a vacation.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare
