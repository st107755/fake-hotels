Nice hotel for first time in Venice-- close to everything-- great location.  My husband and I traveled with our 9 year old- triple occupancy was good value. Decent breakfast.  Very nice front desk and very helpful.  To be picky..Did not LoVe the pillows - but very tired so we slept anyway, and I am picky about mold in shower-- so that bothered me- but would definitely stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
