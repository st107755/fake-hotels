Location, excellent if your trip includes Saint Marks Square a stones throw away. Shops and restaurants of the finest available.  Vaparetto stop lets you off 2 streets away.  The hotel however lacks in comfort the beds were horrible we tried to change our room the staff were very accommodating but beds were old. Some rooms reeked with cigarettes smell. Our room was on 5th floor elevator went to the 4th so you had to carry luggage up a very steep flight of stairs. The breakfast was very extensive for Continental, several cereals, yogurts, fruit ,eggs, bacon juices, croissants and coffe. Not worth $250. a night.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
