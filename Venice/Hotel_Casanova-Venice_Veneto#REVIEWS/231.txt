I take tour groups to Italy and I just LOVE this hotel. Whenever I can, I stay here. The hotel itself is just adorable. It looks like it probably did 500 yrs ago, only with a modern and updated touch. The rooms are ample by European standards, very clean and updated.The breakfast is very nice. The location can't be beat - about a block off of San Marco and a spit from the vaporetto stop. It's tucked away so the noise level is never a problem. It's not that expensive by Venetian standards but for the price, you can't beat the location. It's lovely. I've recommended it more times than I can count and no one's complained yet!Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
