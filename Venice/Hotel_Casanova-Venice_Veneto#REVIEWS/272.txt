I was supposed to be staying at Ca`del Campo Hotel,but when i arrived, they said there was water damage and i could not stay,so they had booked me into this one.   Single room was tiny and dark, large newly decorated bathroom. The view looked onto a narrow dark street, good thing was there was no noise at all. Bed was rock hard. Breakfast was not very good, a ilttle basket with tiny little roll,croissant,a yogurt jams etc.  Good points the staff were very helpfull, and the location was excellent, literally out of hotel,turn left, left at the end by Guetta store, straight on 1 min and you are in St Marks Square.(3 minute walk max).  Free use of laptop with internet.  I know you dont spend much time in your room,but i wanted a view of a little canal or a quaint street,as i wouldâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
