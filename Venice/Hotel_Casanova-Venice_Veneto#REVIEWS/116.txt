stayed 3 nights recently, the location is perfect, able to walk all around Venice easily. Very good breakfast is the plus side, beds are the downside, awful mattresses. The rooms were clean however, which makes up for its worn out appearance, but after all, we are in Venice. Price was right, so no complaining!!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
