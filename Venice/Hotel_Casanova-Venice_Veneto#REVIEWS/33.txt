Not particularly easy to find but once there brilliantly located being very close to St Marks Square. Had to wait quite a long time to book in, and booked in by a rather grumpy and miserable receptionist. Room facilities very good, bed comfortable and room clean. Breakfast had a good range and was well presented. Overall an ok hotel, location being the best feature.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
