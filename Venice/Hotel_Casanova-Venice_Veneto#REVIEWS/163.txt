Many thanks for all staff of this hotel!  Very good breakfast with fruits, omelette, sausages etc. We had large room with 2 beds and sofa, for January was very warm and comfortable. Wi-fi only in lobby but we have no problem with it and had cool lobby - time.  Supper location - about 50-70 m from Sam Marco on the commercial street with shops and souvenir stores. And we find very good price per 1 night with good service! Thanks thanks thanks!!!Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare
