We stayed here in the Winter of 2010 and although rooms are tiny (pretty though with stylish furniture) you won't regret location. You'll have three minutes walk from Piazza San Marco where you can spend the whole day! Service very nice, free access to the Internet and small breakfast in the morning. It is not our favorite hotel in Venice but if you could not find anything else we would stay here again --- price is incredible!Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
