The hotel is downtown Venice, just near San Marco square on one of the small streets around. The location is very good if you for visiting but is quite noisy - our room had the windows to the street. It's not a problem if you spend a week-end there, it could be a problem for families with small children. The room was clean, nice, with all the facilities I would expect beside internet connection (poor, only in the reception you could have signal). Quite expensive but I can say this could be due to location and also the period we have been there (August is high season).Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
