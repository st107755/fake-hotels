We stayed there a few weeks ago on our way to our cruise.  Disembarking from the water bus, a gentleman offered to take our luggage to the hotel for 30 euros (we thought that was a deal since we had 6 bags!).  Check-in was a breeze, the room was cozy, clean and comfortable.  We missed breakfast (we were so sad--we had heard great things about it) as we overslept;  We'd stay here again in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
