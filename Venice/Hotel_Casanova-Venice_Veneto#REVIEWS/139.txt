This hotel was extremely close to St Mark's Square and a very short walk from the Airport Water Taxi drop off making it very convenient. The location makes it definitely worth staying. The rooms are a bit dated and could do with an update and a deep clean in places but overall it was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was extra but a reasonable price and sets you up for the day. Nice coffee with pastries and usual continental spread. If you just want somewhere in the centre and aren't looking for 4 star luxury then this is ideal.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
