Fantastic value, great location. In the heart of Venice close to all major attractions.  just a few minutes away from water taxis which take you to and from the airport. Rooms are clean and basic, breakfast was really good (hot chocolate was amazing). If you are looking for a quaint no frills hotel this should be your first choice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
