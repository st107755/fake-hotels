We found this Hotel from a Rick Steves' forum. It met all of our needs very comfortably an within budget.  Location - Easily accessible to San Marco area and walkable to restaurants and shops.   Service - Breakfast was very lovely every morning. Housekeeping was prompt and thorough. The front desk was always helpful when we had questions about directions or exhibits.  Rooms - Small, but comfortable queen bed. We had a full size bathtub and all the tolietries were provided.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
