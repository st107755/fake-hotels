Perfect location near Piazza San Marco and a good base to explore the city. Large, comfortable suite with two bedrooms, stylish decor, aircon and city views. Only thing missing was in room coffee and tea making facilities.  Breakfast facilities more than adequate. Staff accomodating and friendly. An authentic local hotel in the heart of Venice that I would recommend.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
