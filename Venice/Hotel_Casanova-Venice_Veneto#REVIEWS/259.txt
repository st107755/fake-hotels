Never having been to Venice before I was addicted to reviews. I have to say some of the reviews for Casanova were out of line. We loved our room #449. New bathroom. A small (thumb nail small) view of the water, top floor. We closed our windows at night and did not hear a thing and I am a light sleeper. The breakfast was very adaquate unless you want to have breakfast be your entire meal for the day. Breakfast was hard rolls, crouisants, yogourt, jams, the best coffee, cheese. The staff was wonderful. the reccomendation  for dinner at Cafe Carla was great. We even had a special escort to the water taxie at Moise with a special pick up call to get us to our Cruise Ship. Only one block from St. Marks. Easy. Loved it. Would go back.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
