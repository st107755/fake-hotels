The location is ideal and the rooms are comfortable and very charming. It is a pity that they did not invest on serving a good espresso or cappuccino instead of having a very low level machine. They could also provide real juices! The rest of the breakfast is ok. We were also expecting a higher quality (and the right quantity) of shower gel and shampooing for a 4 stars hotel. Very nice personnel instead very kind and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare
