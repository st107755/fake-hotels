Had a wonderful time in amazing Venice. Hotel was superb,great location and immaculate throughout the hotel. Room was spacious and clean with a TV that even allowed you to log into Netflix. Bed was massive and breakfast was excellent. This hotel is right in the heart of the designer district of Venice so if you love the high life of shopping you are in for a treat!Read moreDate of stay: January 2019HelpfulShare
