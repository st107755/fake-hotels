It's undeniably that this hotel is great for it's location. 5 mins walk to St Mark's Sq and a few mins walk to Actv and Alilaguna station. The hotel room still kept it's design and decorations from 20 or 30 years back, making it very vintage. Cleanliness was good and free wifi are provided at the lobby. The downside of the hotel, it could get pretty noisy in the middle of the night which you can hear people walking and talking on the streets.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
