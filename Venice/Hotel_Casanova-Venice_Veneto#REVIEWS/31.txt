We stayed for two nights in June 2019. Great hotel with English speaking reception, everything was very clean and it is in a great part of Venice. Just off Piazza San Marco but very quiet, even on the 1st floor. 2 minutes from the aqualina station and 30 seconds to a gondola station. All the tv was in Italian but there is a button on the remote to log into Netflix. Not that you’ll be watching much tv.   Don’t eat at the tourist restaurants. Try places like Al Casin dei Nobili. The gondoliers ate there so must be a locals restaurant. Fantastic food!Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
