We stays in this hotel for 2 nights and this was one of the shabbiest hotel I have ever seen .the place is so broken down our bathroom door was all broken one widowed broken the furniture is something one would find in a dumpster one girl in the lobby was the rudest snappiest thing I have seen to anyone that she dealt with . The other one was really nice .breakfast was decent enough and it was a nice area .the fridge was broken .the location was great .but I would never stay in this dump again .we were with 2 other couples and their rooms were also lousy .and the bathrooms were very mouldyRead moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
