We stayed here for two nights with my partner. The location is excellent. A stones throw from St. Mark's Square.   The rooms were very luxurious and in excellent condition! The bathroom was perfect and the Wifi was great.   Breakfast was poor. I wouldn't be recommending the breakfast, but the hotel is worth the cost!   Would certainly recommend!Read moreDate of stay: July 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
