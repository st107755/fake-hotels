Went there in Sept. 14. The third floor smelled like there was a dead body somewhere. We had to sleep with the windows open and all the noise from outside didn't allow us to sleep. The one elevator broke on our last day and we had to carry the luggage down three tiny flights of stairs. The shower floor was dirty and I feared we would catch fungus. We paid over $250 a night. I cannot believe they get away with charging that for this rat hole. Internet works in the lobby. The old man checking you in is grumpy. The continental breakfast was ok.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
