We stayed here as a family of 4 for 1 night in July. We arrived from the other side of Venice where we had stayed 2 nights previous we arrived here by vaporetto which was fabulously close to the hotel as is St Mark Square and Harry Pickerings Bar along with fabulous designer boutiques.   Upon arrival you are greeted with a terrible smell at reception. Thankfully our room was on the 5th floor where the smell seemed to dim a little. Unfortunately being on the 5th floor the lift only goes up to the 4th floor there we had to climb a set of very uneven stairs with 2 very large heavy suitcases.  The room was to have had a minibar which was basically a fridge, there was nothing in ours??? The rooms are badly dated but clean enough to put your head down for the night. The bathroom OKâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
