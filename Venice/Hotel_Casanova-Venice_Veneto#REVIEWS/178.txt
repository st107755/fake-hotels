Excellent Location, slightly tired yet comfortable & romantic room - adding to the atmosphere of Venice. We were fortunate to be allocated the room with the roof top terrace - perfect for drinking prosecco whilst watching the sunset over the city! Breakfast was buffet style with excellent choice of cereals, fruit, hot food & pastries/bread. All in all a fabulous stay. We will be back!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
