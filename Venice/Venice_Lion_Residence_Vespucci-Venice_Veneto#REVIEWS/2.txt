Around half an hour tram ride into the centre of venice. Check in was easy, Teo on reception was easy to contact via WhatsApp for any requests or concerns we had. The room was spacious and clean. We had a shared bathroom which was clean and even had a washing machine in. We didn't get chance to try breakfast as it wasn't on until 8.30am which was too late for us. Wifi was good.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019ValueServiceSleep QualityHelpfulShare
