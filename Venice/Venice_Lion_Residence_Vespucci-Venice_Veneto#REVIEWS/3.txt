Stayed with my sister in a 2-bed room for 2 nights and had a communal bathroom. Rooms were clean and comfy. The staff was incredibly nice. The lady personally made us cappuccinos on arrival. My sister and I had trouble figuring out how to reach the tram to Venice, and one of their staff worked with us until we had figured out how to work the tram service, which was greatly appreciated as it was our first time traveling out of the country and we did not speak the language. The Venice Lion Residence - Vespucci is an excellent option if you are traveling to Venice or want to explore the Mestre area!Read moreDate of stay: May 2019RoomsServiceSleep QualityTrip type: Traveled with family1 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
