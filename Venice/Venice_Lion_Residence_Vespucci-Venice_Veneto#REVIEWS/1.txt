Small but very nice and clean hotel. Our room had been tydied every day. The personal was really nice and helpful. Breakfast was simple, but delicious (it was even gluten free choises). The tram and bus stops are not far away so you can reach Venice easily and quickly.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019Trip type: Traveled as a coupleHelpfulShare
